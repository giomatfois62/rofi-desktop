That time is so important, not only to help yourself, it can also help others. We are at the beginning of many new journeys and want to share them with you. Some topics will be common, where others are not. Our hope is that this will allow us all to grow. It takes a village to raise a child; and a strong foundation to stand upon in times of transition. Blending families, oneness through marriage, relocation and so much more. Join us as we navigate through it all. \u200b It's all about transitions.

So, hosts Somer and Barclay have created a podcast where we can do just that! Hence, the After Party! Somer and Barclay are long-time besties and both professional Uber drivers, chefs, maids, party planners, executive assistants, home designers and organizers extraordinaire - or in other words, moms. They both have been married for over 20 years and each have four awesome kiddos. Each episode they will ask the MOPS speaker to come back and continue the conversation from their meeting. They will discuss varying topics, but all relevant to every mom, woman, and maybe even the men! Somer and Barclay hope every person that listens comes away feeling like they were part of the conversation and heard something that was meaningful to them. \n\nYou can find each speaker's talk from MOPS on our Instagram! @thechapelmopsafterparty ",

It takes us back to the moment that was joyous, or traumatic. It moves through us.\n\nHearing a birth story from our own communities is so important. We learn what the birth culture has in store for us, we learn what options we have in our area, and we can connect and build community much more deeply.\n\nThis podcast is a place to hear the stories of people giving birth within Whatcom County, WA. A place where we can tell our stories and be heard and seen. A place where maybe our story will reach the person it needs to, to help them make a decision in their pregnancy, birth or postpartum.\n\nWhatcom Birth Stories will also hear from local birth professionals who can be a tremendous support during our childbearing years.\n\nEnjoy these stories from our community.

Truth Talk, Time to Pray, Victorious Family Life, Faith has a Voice, and more. The TRUTH spoken is the spark that ignites revival in hearts that have grown cold. Jesus spoke truth. Not everyone was happy to hear the truth. Yet, 2000 years later, there is still power in speaking it! Speaking the truth in love will win the lost, set the captives free, deliver the bound, heal the oppressed, and re-ignite those who have lost the fire they once had. At Truth Revival, we desire to help you find God\u2019s perfect plan for your life. Speaking truth does not always make us popular, but it does make us obedient to our Heavenly Father and His Word! Woe to you when ALL men speak well of you; for so did their fathers to the false prophets. ~Luke 6:26 NKJ Then Peter and the apostles replied, \u201cWe must obey God rather than men [we have no other choice]. ~Acts 5:29 AMP www.TruthRevivalNow.com CashApp $TruthRevival Paypal @TruthRevival</p>",

So we decided to create this podcast, where we will each sit down separately for 3 minutes, 4 nights a week, Monday thru Thursday, to record what happened for us that day. We will not edit or do multiple takes. When our 3 minutes are up, we stop. Then it's the next person's turn. Simple!</p><p>On the weekends, we record our 30 minute Weekend Edition together, where we review the week and finish unfinished business, available exclusively on <a href>Patreon for as little as $5/month</a>.</p><p>Making this podcast together is our way of doing something consistently and simply, in the midst of all our respective long term creative goals and projects, that often drain us and leave us feeling depleted. We hope you'll come along on this journey with us as we find our way by being candid, honest and most importantly, seeing and listening to each other. We'll do this as long as it helps our marriage.</p><p>Thank you for being here with us!

Divorce, grief, diversity, money, mental\nhealth, disability, going back to work, friendships, illness \u2013 the list is\nendless but they affect our lives as mothers and our walk with Jesus.\nWhen secular culture is talking about all these things and we can\u2019t hear\nGod in the discussion it can seem confusing and isolating.\n\nWe felt called to add Jesus to the equation of life as a mum by sharing\nwomen\u2019s stories and experiences of how Jesus has impacted their\nwalk with him. Jesus tells us we\u2019re \u201cthe salt of the earth\u201d (Matt 5.13) and\nwe need to keep salty- that means in our whole lives and that means\nwe need to talk about where Jesus is in motherhood too.",

The term \"m(others)\" encompasses both \"mothers\" and \"others,\" including gender non-conforming and queer folks, who see themselves engaged in nurturing and sustaining life. In this podcast, we interview Kjipuktuk Halifax-based visual artists who are also primary caregivers about their experiences navigating parenting and the art world. We discuss the ways in which their art practices have been impacted by parenthood, navigating how care work can be both an exceedingly disruptive force as well as a profound emotional experience that can expand our conceptions of art-making, interdependency and existence.</p><p>Cover art by David Drummond</p>",
