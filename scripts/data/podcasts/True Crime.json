        "description": "<p>They found their sister's sneaker near a wooden fence. There was no note, visible sign of a struggle or an accident. But a 10-year-old girl who lived a serene, happy life disappeared in August 1993 while on vacation at her grandparent's house in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. On that horrible day, she and her baby brother took a 5-minute walk to see a litter of collie puppies play on a neighbor's property. Her brother returned home shortly afterward, leaving his sister alone. Then she was gone. No one saw what happened. Or so it seems.</p><p>Just before her disappearance, about 200 yards away, a man in a pickup truck leered at two teen girls, terrifying them as they checked their mailbox. They feared he was about to grab one of them. Holly Piirainen's remains were found 79 days later in the woods about nine miles away. The medical examiner marked it a homicide.</p><p>A team of retired investigators believes the man in the pickup is responsible for the abduction and murder of Holly, but her case is still unsolved. Three decades later, Holly's story has never been told in its entirety. With the cooperation of Holly's family, I decided to tackle the story of what happened that day. Let's discover what we know and don't know and who are the persons of interest. And...let\u2019s be prepared to uncover some new details along the way.</p><p>MEDIA INQUIRIES ONLY: Contact Richard Price: <a href=\"mailto:shortwalkmedia1@gmail.com\">shortwalkmedia1@gmail.com</a>; (508) 614-9367\u202c</p>",

        "title": "Policing Greene: A Policeman at the Sunset of the Jim Crow South",
        "description": "In 1964 at age 48, Carlton Lewis took an abrupt turn in life to become a policeman in a rural Georgia county - half white, half black \u2013 that must cope with new federal civil rights laws. He was a roughneck Son of the South whose grandfather owned slaves. How would he perform in his new role? Would he treat all Greene County citizens fairly and equally regardless of their color? This is the true story of an exceptional police officer at a turning point in U.S. history.\n\nRecruited as a deputy to legendary Greene County Sheriff L. L. Wyatt, Carlton Lewis rose to become Wyatt\u2019s Chief Deputy before taking on the job of Chief of Police of the small Greene County town of Union point. His 22-year career led Carlton Lewis through many incidents and encounters ranging from murder and extortion to banishing a peacock. Along the way, Carlton\u2019s predilection for a good fight and equal justice for all of Greene\u2019s citizens exposed him to dangers mostly unknown to his family.\n\nWhen it was clear that federally-enforced integration of schools would occur in Georgia, the Greene County school superintendent stated that they would do the right thing without being ordered by having a few teachers volunteer to go the black and white schools to set examples for the community. Carlton\u2019s wife Eleanor was the first white teacher to volunteer to go to the black school. This was a clear indication of the Lewis family\u2019s attitude towards the societal changes coming their way. While Carlton would arrest and get in \u201ctussles\u201d with many of Greene County African Americans throughout his policing years, he would make sure that they received the same treatment in the justice system as did the white citizens he arrested. When Sheriff Wyatt died in 1977, community black leaders encouraged Carlton to run for the vacant office. He was grateful for such support but decided to complete his career by staying on as the Union Point police chief.\n\nIn early 1986, as Carlton was approaching retirement, his son Tom, then Chief of Staff to Georgia Governor Joe Frank Harris, sat down with his dad and recorded their conversation about Carlton's policing exploits. Two months later, and just two weeks after his retirement, Carlton Lewis collapsed and died while on one of his daily walks. He had been shot at, bludgeoned on the head, and bloodied in numerous knock-down-drag-outs but survived his policing career only to be taken down by a fatal heart attack. \n\nThose audio recordings were incorporated in the 2018 book Policing Greene written in a collaboration between Tom and his friend Hal McAlister, who worked together at Georgia State University where Tom was a senior Vice President and Advisor to the President and Hal was Regents Professor of Astronomy. Their book is available on Amazon.com. Now, you can hear Carlton, Tom, and others describe incidents and encounters from the book, brought back to life in their own voices in these five podcast episodes.  \n\nThis podcast is sponsored by Team BlueLine, a non-profit giving back to families of fallen officers physically or mentally injured in the line of duty. Visit teamblueline.org. \n\nThe episodes were produced by Andrew (Drew) Nelson with the editing assistance of Marion (Mars) Rinaldi. Drew narrates the series, and Mars reads occasional passages from the book. You can learn more about the book at amazon.com and halmcalister.com.\n",

As investigators feverishly search for clues, the narrative swiftly evolves into a complex tapestry of characters with conflicting testimonies. With each twist and turn, the audience is drawn deeper into the shadowy corners of the victims' lives and a labyrinth of potential suspects. Through riveting storytelling, meticulous evidence analysis, and insightful expert perspectives, listeners are immersed in the investigation. Firsthand interviews are expertly woven together to vibrantly portray the victims' personas, lurking motives, and law enforcement's unyielding quest for justice. As the series unfolds, we are presented with a spectrum of viewpoints - from the relentless efforts of law enforcement and forensic experts to the harrowing experiences of friends and family forever marked by this tragedy. Amid these narratives, more prominent themes begin to emerge, which probe the essence of justice, the weight of communal bonds, and the ceaseless pursuit of truth. This true crime saga transcends a mere crime to solve as it morphs into a profound exploration of human behavior under duress, the resilience of people grappling with sorrow, and the extremes one will traverse in their quest for answers and closure. With each unfolding chapter, the sequence of events seamlessly guides us through a labyrinthine path of raw emotion as the intricate layers of the investigation peel away. Along the way, we are tempted, rather beseeched, to confront the shadows that linger beneath the veneer of our own lives.</p><p>Produced, Written &amp; Edited by Cory Zimmerman.</p><p>Produced by August Olsen of Lone Bird Media.</p><p>Research by Jinra Ilustrisimo, Anna Maria Cannon &amp; Chelseah Mesa.</p><p>Contact SRG at: <a href=\"mailto:cz@studios.works\">cz@studios.works</a>.</p><p>Visit SRG at: <a href=\"http://www.spoonrivergothic.com\">www.spoonrivergothic.com</a>.</p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/srg.podcast/\">@srg.podcast</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SRG_Presents\">@srg.presents</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Spoon.River.Gothic.Podcast\">/Spoon.River.Gothic.Podcast</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsiq77HC2lxMWECYPIwHlng\">@Spoon.River.Gothic.Podcast</a></p>",
