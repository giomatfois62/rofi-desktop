They have gone through job changes, life changes and delved in and out of many hobbies and somehow the weather still weaves in and out of their lives. \n\nSo this podcast is for anyone who would like to join our weather conversations and wherever the jet stream may take us!\n                                   \nWe hope you join us for our bi weekly chat and leave each episode loving the weather just that little bit more.",

They are on the ground, creating critical shifts in seemingly intractable and highly unsustainable systems. And they've been doing so for a long time. \n\nIn this series, we look to explore beyond the soil, to the underlying theme of transformation itself across multiple dimensions: from that very internal landscape of human consciousness to the outer manifestation in the world around us, be it in the form of agricultural management practices, tools and techniques, to culture, economics, policy, and the built environment. \n \nThis series is a joint venture with Soil4Climate and my own organization, the Ouroboros Agency, where we work to help transform the human social infrastructure, and the built environment, to create truly resilient and regenerative societies. \n \nThese recordings originally aired as interactive livestream interviews on social media. They were held during the initial months of the US Covid lockdown and due to limited facilities, we sometimes had to get creative with our locations and dealt with the occasional technical issue. ",

Some of those uses are obvious: washing dishes, swimming, or watering plants. Others are less obvious: generating energy, building roads, and manufacturing goods that travel far from the water\u2019s source to reach their destination. But even given those many uses\u2014and the many more users who expect clean water on demand\u2014it\u2019s easy to take for granted how critical this one resource is to life.\n\nWhat, exactly, is the value of water? We try to answer this question through a series of engaging conversations with experts in their fields, and, hopefully, inspire a new appreciation of the waters you call home.\n\nTHE COLLECTIVE TAP is a project of the White River Alliance, a 501(c)(3)organization located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We are an alliance of diverse interests and organizations that work together to steward the River and its watershed. It is made possible with generous funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.\n\nProduced in partnership with Absorb., a boutique music and media label. ",

        "description": "<p>Listen to stories about historic Markham Hill in the middle of Fayetteville, Arkansas. Markham Hill contains 300 acres of intact, urban forest and natural areas, several Pratt family-built structures, at least two Native American sites, and has a history of cultural importance to the area, including a boys &amp; girls camp from the 1920s-1940s, hippies and students living in the abandoned camp cabins from the 1950s-2000s, over 40 years of University of Arkansas runners on the trails, wildlife studies, horseback riding, bird walks, etc. However, developers have bought almost half of the mountain so far and plan to deforest and develop it. Friends of Markham Hill is a grass roots effort to save Markham Hill from deforestation and development. But we need help spreading the word and using public pressure to protect this land. This podcast contains at least 80 'Weekly Markham Hill Moments of History' that were initially posted on Facebook, sent to the Fayetteville City Council, and aired on Fayetteville's KPSQ 97.3 FM Community Radio. So far, the developers and Big Money are winning. They have started deforesting. Please share this podcast and help spread the word. Thank you so much. Let's save Markham Hill!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Born a trickle from high in the Rocky Mountains, the Elbow River flows for 120km through mountains and foothills before entering the Bow River in Mohkinstis (Calgary, Alberta). After joining the Bow River system, the waters eventually flow into the Hudson\u2019s Bay as the Nelson River. Over 500,000 people rely on the Elbow River for their drinking water. There are many other ways people and all creatures big and small rely on Elbow waters. The Elbow River is a part of the source waters for 3 provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). The Lake Winnipeg Basin (a part of the Nelson River) flows across the territories of Treaties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>This pilot series titled \"Voices from the Elbow\" looks at the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 Calgary, AB and surrounding area flood. ' June 2023 marked the 10th year anniversary of the most recent flood on the Elbow River. Topics we touch on during this pilot podcast: water and climate, water quantity (flood, drought), water management, water quality, restoration, wetlands, nature-based solutions, nature appreciation, and communities that are a part of the Elbow and Bow basins.</p><p>The impact of the flood can still be seen today (for example - constructing engineered berms, constructing Springbank Reservoir, higher insurance rates, and PTSD). We conducted a range of interviews with scientists, The City of Calgary water management and the former ED of the local non-profit watershed planning and advisory council, to learn about actions that have been taken since 2013 to help mitigate flood impacts and make the watershed more resilient (to both flood and drought). This is also an opportunity to explore and share knowledge about the watershed, its ecosystem, its climate and what impact there was from the flood and the river\u2019s natural processes.</p><p>There are three hosts of Voices from the Elbow:</p><p>Jer Bobosky, Jer Bobosky is N\u00eehithaw (Woodland Cree) from mihkw\u00e2kam\u00eewi-s\u00eep\u00eesis (Little Red River Cree Nation). Jer is a Podcast technician with the Elbow River Watershed Project working on the \u201c10-year Flood Anniversary\" episodes as well as the \u201cTsuut'ina Aquatic Habitat Restoration\u201d podcast. She was connected to ERWP from community involvement at UCalgary as an undergraduate student in Political Science, with a primary focus on Indignizing and decolonizing political philosophy.</p><p>Flora Giesbrecht is the Executive Director for the non-profit organization, Elbow River Watershed Partnership (ERWP).</p><p>Tyler Redmond was an Integrated Water Management student from SAIT at the time of the interview. He worked with the ERWP as part of his capstone project.</p><p>The Elbow River Watershed Partnership (ERWP) is a non-profit watershed stewardship organization based out of Calgary Alberta. Our vision - Working together for a healthy Elbow River watershed.</p><p>ERWP mission - is to improve the watershed and bring together communities who live, work or play in the watershed <em>(provides a forum for learning about watershed management and the land-water connection. Using local knowledge and scientific expertise, the ERWP promotes watershed management improvement through collaborative, targeted and cost-effective actions by all who have an interest in the watershed.)</em></p>",

They help regulate the air, reduce pollution, provide oxygen, prevent floods and droughts, conserve biodiversity, and improve people's quality of life.</p><p>Air conditioner</p><p>Trees help regulate the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that causes the greenhouse effect, which contributes to climate change. Oxygen is an essential gas for the life of humans and other animals.</p><p>Reduce pollution</p><p>Trees also help reduce air pollution by filtering dust and other pollutants. Dust and pollutants can cause health problems like asthma, bronchitis and lung cancer.</p><p>Oxygen supply</p><p>Trees provide oxygen for humans and other animals. Oxygen is a gas necessary for life. One tree can provide oxygen for about 10 people in a day.</p><p>Preventing floods and droughts</p><p>Trees help prevent floods and droughts by holding water in the soil. When it rains, plants absorb water from the soil and use it to grow. This helps to reduce the amount of water that flows into rivers, lakes and seas, thereby preventing flooding. When it's dry, trees release water into the atmosphere, thereby helping to reduce drought.</p><p>Conservation of biodiversity</p><p>Trees are home to many animals, including birds, insects, small animals and mammals. Trees help conserve biodiversity by providing food, shelter and breeding grounds for animals.</p><p>Improve people's quality of life</p><p>Trees help improve people's quality of life by reducing stress, enhancing concentration and improving mood. Trees also help reduce noise and create a green and beautiful living environment.</p><p>In short, trees have a huge impact on the environment. They help regulate the air, reduce pollution, provide oxygen, prevent floods and droughts, conserve biodiversity, and improve people's quality of life. We need to plant and protect trees to protect the environment and improve our quality of life.</p>",
