        "description": "<p>Politics Under the Microscope captures the thought process of policy makers as they respond to complex problems and to discuss the implications those policies will have for the scientific community and broader society. Each episode starts by briefing the listener on a societal problem using an anecdote, then will reframe the problem with a science policy-related question, and finally engage the listener by integrating audio from multiple expert interviews. Taken together, these will shape the role science can and may play in developing policies in response to political and social issues. Our unique approach lies in our ability to layer scientific and political facts in a single narrative, with an emphasis on capturing the principles of scientific and creative problem solving to address a diverse range of topics that caters to many interests.

        "description": "This is a platform for the extraordinary women leading the regenerative agricultural movement\u2014and the transformation of our societies--around the world. They are on the ground, creating critical shifts in seemingly intractable and highly unsustainable systems. And they've been doing so for a long time. \n\nIn this series, we look to explore beyond the soil, to the underlying theme of transformation itself across multiple dimensions: from that very internal landscape of human consciousness to the outer manifestation in the world around us, be it in the form of agricultural management practices, tools and techniques, to culture, economics, policy, and the built environment. \n \nThis series is a joint venture with Soil4Climate and my own organization, the Ouroboros Agency, where we work to help transform the human social infrastructure, and the built environment, to create truly resilient and regenerative societies. \n \nThese recordings originally aired as interactive livestream interviews on social media. They were held during the initial months of the US Covid lockdown and due to limited facilities, we sometimes had to get creative with our locations and dealt with the occasional technical issue. ",

The cave fish, pale pink without eyes, lives in underground caves below its surface cousin which is silvery gray with black eyes. Today Astyanax is a model to study genetics, disease and behavior.\n\nThe story includes jungle explorers braving plane crashes and venomous snakes to find the cavefish and the scientists who studied it including a renowned German professor who fled Nazi Germany and a female Turkish scientist, Perihan Sadoglu who did some of the first genetic work in the 1950\u2019s, but who mysteriously disappeared mid-career. The podcast follows the stories of scientists past and present revealing clues along the way to find out what had happened to Dr. Sadoglu and why it matters now.",

Episodes include How the Internet Connects Us, The Importance of Improving Water Quality, and Why the Scientific Method Isn\u2019t Just for Scientists. In order to cater this podcast to rural communities, I have partnered with various public libraries across the state of Iowa to establish content areas of interest and ways to reach their patrons. The podcasts consist of interviews with professionals and faculty at the University of Iowa that have extensive experience in the areas of interest. These short episodes are intended to be easily digestible in order to get people excited about science and how it works without us even knowing.",

        "description": "<p>Refer the Reefer with host Michael Alkire aka Lil Pharmer is a podcast that references medical cannabis consumption practices, methods and habits of medical cannabis consumers, long time cannabis activists and medical cannabis researchers who are pioneers in their studies. There is not much reliable information, for people to search for when looking for answers on how to consume medical cannabis responsibly for different ailments. Here we hope to shed light on proper ways to prep and consume medical cannabis for these different ailments that it is said to help relieve. Nowadays there are 100s of products and ways to consume them. Even to an experienced consumer there are always new things to be learned about the ever-changing world of legal cannabis. It is becoming ever increasingly popular in many parts of the world and being legalized for usage. More and more people are wanting to try cannabis for the first time, whether it be for recreational purposes or medical relief of any type. More and more people suffering from chronic illnesses that find little to no relief from pharmaceutical prescriptions and want to explore new options. After working in a recreational dispensary in Breckenridge, Colorado for 3 years, talking to clients from all over the world about why they consume and how it helps them, it has become clear that there are benefits to their consumption. Everyone has a unique Endocannabinoid System (ECS) and cannabis effects everyone a little bit differently depending on their own personal chemistry. What is the ECS and what does it control or do? The ECS is complicated, and experts haven\u2019t yet determined exactly how it works or all of its potential functions are listed below. \u2022 appetite and digestion \u2022 metabolism \u2022 chronic pain \u2022 inflammation and other immune system responses \u2022 mood \u2022 learning and memory \u2022 motor control \u2022 sleep \u2022 cardiovascular system function \u2022 muscle formation \u2022 bone remodeling and growth \u2022 liver function \u2022 reproductive system function \u2022 stress \u2022 skin and nerve function These functions all contribute to homeostasis, which refers to stability of your internal environment. For example, if an outside force, such as pain from an injury or a fever, throws off your body\u2019s homeostasis, your ECS kicks in to help your body return to its ideal operation. Today, experts believe that maintaining homeostasis if the primary role of the ECS. We will also be talking about the benefits of legalization, debunk the stigmas of Refer Madness and normalize cannabis consumption for everyone Worldwide. That being said cannabis isn\u2019t for everyone and sometime can cause unwanted side-effects. This could be due to many factors including improper growing, contaminants and/or over consuming one's personal limits. Some people need to eat higher concentrates of edible cannabis and get the same effect as the next person. Sometimes 2.5 mg of THC is enough for one person and then 200 mg for the next to get the same desired effects. We will talk about how to avoid these bad situations and how to deal with them if they occur. We will also reference situations that occurred while trying to retrieve black market cannabis in the past and explain why it is better that it is legal. There are also thousands of different chemovars and cultivars of cannabis out there currently and thousands to come in the near future. These are many new terms that are being used in the industry now and some terms like Indica and Sativa that are not being used as much. Chemovars are used to describe cannabis strains by the chemical contents of the strain with terpene profiles and cannabinoid percentages present in each batch. Cultivars are used to describe a batch with a name of a strain, with the name of the grower and type of cultivation method used to grow it.</p>",

They help regulate the air, reduce pollution, provide oxygen, prevent floods and droughts, conserve biodiversity, and improve people's quality of life.</p><p>Air conditioner</p><p>Trees help regulate the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that causes the greenhouse effect, which contributes to climate change. Oxygen is an essential gas for the life of humans and other animals.</p><p>Reduce pollution</p><p>Trees also help reduce air pollution by filtering dust and other pollutants. Dust and pollutants can cause health problems like asthma, bronchitis and lung cancer.</p><p>Oxygen supply</p><p>Trees provide oxygen for humans and other animals. Oxygen is a gas necessary for life. One tree can provide oxygen for about 10 people in a day.</p><p>Preventing floods and droughts</p><p>Trees help prevent floods and droughts by holding water in the soil. When it rains, plants absorb water from the soil and use it to grow. This helps to reduce the amount of water that flows into rivers, lakes and seas, thereby preventing flooding. When it's dry, trees release water into the atmosphere, thereby helping to reduce drought.</p><p>Conservation of biodiversity</p><p>Trees are home to many animals, including birds, insects, small animals and mammals. Trees help conserve biodiversity by providing food, shelter and breeding grounds for animals.</p><p>Improve people's quality of life</p><p>Trees help improve people's quality of life by reducing stress, enhancing concentration and improving mood. Trees also help reduce noise and create a green and beautiful living environment.</p><p>In short, trees have a huge impact on the environment. They help regulate the air, reduce pollution, provide oxygen, prevent floods and droughts, conserve biodiversity, and improve people's quality of life.
