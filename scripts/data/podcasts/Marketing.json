I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to keep that privilege to myself and I think you deserve to be utterly lifted and shifted by these people too. What sort of people?

You can learn more about that right here: https://linktr.ee/awaresocialmedia\n\nI focus on creating effective branding and messaging for people and communities who are often left out of mainstream marketing. Part of that mission involves having a keen understanding of social awareness...and in my case, that meaning is twofold.\n\nWhy is it so important to properly and effectively represent LGBTQ+ people and all people who might be considered \"other\" in society? Because being represented by someone who looks and IS like you\u2014someone who shares your experiences\u2014makes a difference. It makes you feel seen, heard, and understood for who you are as an individual\u2026not just as a member of a group. When we feel seen, our self-esteem rises; we feel empowered; we have more confidence in ourselves and our abilities. And that confidence translates into success: career advancement, higher paychecks (if you're working), better relationships with friends and family members\u2026even better health outcomes!\n\nLet me be clear, however, that I know I do not speak for everyone. I may be bisexual, but I am still an able-bodied, cisgender, white male. This platform is intended to create a space for people from many diverse communities to come together and share their stories, businesses, and to discuss topics relating to social media and representation.

You only hear about debt when you are personally struggling financially.  \n\nThere are also regulatory changes or changes in the types of debts the sector deals with in recent times compared to just consumer credit debts. A debtor who seeks advice may also have other issues to resolve: domestic abuse, gambling, and benefit problems to just name a few.\n\nThe series of Debt Talk podcasts are here to explore the views of a diverse range of communities  - from debt collections, enforcement agents, and alternative lenders to debt advice charities-  and understand the support need of debtors in such a challenging time.\n\nRipon Ray has been working in the debt advice sector for over 12 years.
