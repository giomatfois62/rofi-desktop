We are students of intelligent investing (we don\u2019t think you ever graduate, do you?), practicing in the skill of value and the art of behavioural, hedged by the protection of macro.\n\nTo enjoy this podcast: You don\u2019t need a mathematics degree. You don\u2019t need to be an economics master. You don\u2019t need to be a fund manager. \n\nYou just need to be: Open to thinking differently. Curious to explore that difference. And financially literate to profit from it.\n\n\u201cIt is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows.\u201d - Epictetus\n\nTwitter: @mitch_dol @kassia_dol\nYoutube: Buffetting with Kass & Mitch\nFB/Insta: @buffettingkassmitch",

However for the Degens we will also be talking about what is going on in Cardano. By making this both a Cardano/everything podcast we will be making it easier for the Normies to get involved in Cardano, while also keeping the Cardano Degens laughing even through a bear market.\n\nIS THAT ALLL????!!!! \n\nFUCK NO!! The Degen Report is planning on being the launching pad! We will also be releasing YouTube videos, that lean more towards the comedic side of Cardano. These will consist of everything from Clips from the podcast, to doing Cardano based tier lists\nWe also plan on doing livestreams! Whether this be us talking to another project about what they are about, playing games with the community or even doing karaoke with the community. We plan on doing it allllll! \n\nWHY???!\nWe at The Degen Report believe that the Cardano Community has been missing a ton of good comedic Influencer based content. Thats where we come in! We plan on filling that whole with content ranging from youtube videos, podcast clips, to livestreams! \n\nWell anyways if you have made it this far... then you are for sure a Degen!\nSo welcome to The Degen Report!",

        "description": "Most mortgage companies are competitive, not collaborative.\nYou get one loan officer, and what your LO can do is limited to their experience and knowledge. The LTW Group takes a different, client-first approach. Our mortgage advisors have complementary skills and areas of specialization, and we work together as one cohesive unit.\nIf your mortgage advisor can\u2019t answer a question for you, they will pull in the right expert. You get a smooth application process, the right advice, and the best loan for your unique situation. We don\u2019t just talk about genuinely caring about your success. We show that we care by keeping up with changes and guidelines. We also show it with clear communication. Do you have updates, questions, or concerns? Do you need a pep talk? We always have time to educate and encourage you. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve created an after-hours line for you. You won\u2019t be left wondering where we are in the process or the status of your application.\n\nSo if you prefer fun, approachable advisors over stiff, starched officers, let\u2019s talk.

Thanks to amazing streaming technology including Podcasting 2.0 I am able to make the audio accessible to people around the world who may be interested in reviewing.  With additional technology I am able to provide transcripts for some of the audio recordings, in the form of unofficial computer auto generated written transcripts.  These transcripts can assist people who are hearing impaired, and other people who prefer to read along.  The unofficial transcripts can be translated into other languages for convenience, by people using Google Translate and other translation tools available on the internet.

        "description": "<p><strong>About The Dave and Marcia Show</strong></p><p>-        Our listeners are financial advisors from all channels and all ages. Many think they provide adequate retirement income advice for clients nearing and living in retirement. Many think they are building relationships with women. Most will find out too late they are not.</p><p>-         We want the listeners to get new, different, and interesting information from the show that they can use to understand the reality out there. They\u2019ll build from:</p><p>o   <strong>Real women. Real stories.</strong> Each woman\u2019s journey is fascinating and filled with unique steps and stumbles and successes. As a society, we don\u2019t celebrate her journey. They are looking for much more than a spreadsheet, a quarterly report on earnings, and a pie chart. But most advisors are not delivering.</p><p>o   <strong>And income.</strong> Dave and Marcia are veterans of the retirement savings and retirement income industry. They know women have been left out of the conversation. They know financial advisors are struggling to understand women clients and win their assets for the long-term. And, they know how women get left out of the money decisions, due to a combination of laws that put her in the backseat and financial advisors who don\u2019t include her in the process or conversation.</p><p>-        In this podcast, we\u2019ll help advisors change course before it\u2019s too late. To help women successfully manage through retirement and have the income they need and want, changes are necessary. Advisors will hear from:</p><p>o   Boomer women about their life\u2019s journey and where they are going next.</p><p>o   From Gen X women who feel left out of the conversations despite their success.</p><p>o   And, from Millennial women who are completely reinventing life as we know it.</p><p> </p><p>It\u2019s no secret women will control the majority of wealth in the next 10 years. It\u2019s estimated that more than two-thirds of wealth will be held by women in the US by 2030. That\u2019s some $30 Trillion that will change hands over the next several years.</p><p>Our mission is to educate financial advisors, wealth managers, and insurance advisors in every channel on how to best serve this powerful market. First from a boomer women\u2019s perspective. Then how to further adapt to handle new challenges and a different definition of \u201cretirement\u201d for younger women.</p>",
