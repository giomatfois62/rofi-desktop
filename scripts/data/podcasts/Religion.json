The church is the mystical body (believers) of Jesus Christ and it has one mission and that is to \"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature\" [Mark 16:15 KJV]. The mission isn't to expand a brand or an enterprise and call it a church. The mission is, as a believer, to tell everyone and everything about the good news concerning the sacrifice that Jesus made (the message), and to everyone that believes this message they shall be saved; and to everyone that does not believe this message shall be damned [Mark 16:16 KJV, emphasis added]. Ekklesia United is focused on carrying out the mission of delivering this message to everyone and everything through digital mediums, ecumenical unification, and live events. There is no need to build another church. The church was empowered, built, and sent back in Acts 2. Today, we are tasked with continuing in the exact same work that started then. Therefore, Ekklesia United is not another church, but rather an assembly of believers united in the mission of preaching/delivering the message, the gospel of Jesus Christ, to everyone and everything so they will be saved.</p><p>Connect with Anthony Richardson, the founder and creator of Ekklesia United, on all social platforms @gr8rimpact or email at <a href=\"mailto:questions@ekklesiaunited.com\">questions@ekklesiaunited.com</a>.

Dominic Clemente, sit down with our Director of Faith Formation, Paul Minarik, for a lively chat that aims to inspire saints who inspire more saints to go build the kingdom of God. As part of this mission, we regularly interview parishioners and chat about how they help make St. Ed's such a wonderful Catholic parish.\n\nFeel free to contact us if you have any requests for upcoming episodes or guest interviews you'd love to hear (maybe YOU should be on the show!).

        "description": "<p>PURPOSE // To gather those called by their Father to know HIM in order to make HIM known // Malachi 4:5-6 Remnant Church of Denton exists for the purpose of raising up sons and daughters of Christ's Kingdom for this generation and the next. Sons and daughters as expressed in 1 Corinthians 4:15 and 1 John 2 speaks in a familial language. Once we begin to study the bible, we can understand the familial perspective from which it was written. In search of authentic relationships that mirror our studies we reach out to our local church. For many of us, this is where the journey ends as we discover institutionalized church that leaves us wanting. The leadership of Remnant Church desires to witness your potential and help you make it reality. Jesus said that the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. We are not interested in gathering numbers or sustaining you on milk. Instead, we look forward to meeting those who God has ordained to make up our Remnant family; to live and learn mutual devotion together and look forward to the day that the student surpasses the teachers. MISSION // To grow, equip, and mature every saint for the work of THE ministry // Ephesians 4:11-13 \"Each generation will praise your works to the next and proclaim your mighty acts.\" Psalms 145:4 CJB Scriptures such as Psalms 145:4, Deuteronomy 4:9-10, Psalm 78:6, and John15, presume that the believer is living according to the Genesis 1:28 mandate which is: to be fruitful, multiply, fill and subdue the earth. This does not exclude those who cannot or have not had physical children. We passionately believe in growing up in the Faith, from sons and daughters to mothers and fathers, that we may indeed make an impact on our current generation. Even more so that we might leave a strong impression on the next. Acts tells us that although God's promises may be first realized by us in our generation, that by design, it is given to us to impact the next. Teaching us not to live as consumers but rather, to lift up and pour into the next generation. Remnant Church\u2019s greatest hope above all, is that the goodness of God that has been so abundantly poured out on our lives would be evident to all. We desire that our lives would be lived with such a passion and affection for Jesus, that what has been freely given to us would be imparted to those around us, whereby, fulfilling the Genesis 1:28 mandate to multiply His presence in this present generation. VISION // To give fully mature sons and daughters to all nations until the full harvest has come in, the bride has made herself ready, and King Jesus is enthroned in Jerusalem // Micah 4:6-8 Discipleship is a lifestyle not a program. We have found it best to simply: - live a life abandoned to Jesus - allow the Holy Spirit to gather those who desire to do the same - enter into everyday life together as we live and learn how to better re-present King Jesus to a hopeless and dying world. VALUES // To guard Holy Spirit empowerment, Lifestyle Evangelism &amp; Missions, Historical Christian Orthodoxy, and Eternal Family // Matthew 28:16-20 \u200b</p>",

You are listening to Senior Evangelist Ps Martin Duffy, Senior Pastor Ross Roberts, and occasionally from our guest preachers. Ps Martin Duffy is the Senior Evangelist and Founder of Elim Church Global who has an apostolic call to the nations. Elim Church Global was founded in 2006 on the Central Coast, NSW, Australia as a base to support global outreach. We are a non-denominational church community where all are warmly welcomed and where the whole counsel of God is preached in the Power of the Holy Spirit. We are a Church which believes that the Word of God is infallible and is to be obeyed. We believe all the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit is for today. We are a Church that is deeply missional; seeking to go into all of the world with the good message of salvation through Jesus Christ. We desire that all who attend meetings encounter God Himself and leave changed by this encounter. We also deeply desire that people are able to flourish in their gifts within a loving and supportive environment. The prophet Isaiah inspired by the Holy Spirit spoke: Behold, I will do a new thing, Now it shall spring forth; Shall you not know it? I will even make a road in the wilderness And rivers in the desert. The beast of the field will honor Me, The jackals and the ostriches, Because I give waters in the wilderness And rivers in the desert, To give drink to My people, My chosen. This people I have formed for Myself; They shall declare My praise.\u201d \u202d\u202dIsaiah\u202c \u202d43\u202c:\u202d19-21\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c We hope and pray Rivers In The Desert will truly enrich and strengthen your spirit-man.

We will not only explore the word of God spoken to his prophets but also, we will put them in the context of today's current events, how you fit into God's plans, and the great joy and blessings that will come from participating in this heaven-ordained movement. We will also discuss the principles we need to learn and master in order to become a Zion people, our hearts knit together in love and unity.</p>",

We see a church that turns careers into callings, and conversations into moments where you sense the Holy Spirit. We see a church that seeks to see Jesus and allows the Creator to create with His most prized possession; us. \n\nYou're invited to the journey, where we seek first the Kingdom and righteousness, and trust that He can add all things in His time.

We also spend about 30 minutes in the Word of God. \n\nThe River is not meant to replace church. We believe you should get rooted in a strong Sunday community.

The truth is that Jesus came to grant us total victory over every aspect and circumstance of life.</p><p>Once you experience this wholeness, the next step is to guide you into your ministry. We are all called to be ministers of Christ. God has planted a sense of purpose within each of us\u2014an innate desire to serve.

Our Lord yearns for you to lead a fulfilled life, and He has a unique plan and destiny for each one of you. Regrettably, only a few ever uncover their destiny, let alone fulfill it.

        "description": "<p>America. The \"land of the free,\" the \"home of the brave.\" We're all quite familiar with the words of Francis Scott Key's song, <em>The Star Spangled Banner</em>. But what is freedom anyway? What is the real meaning behind the word Liberty? Do we really know, or is it just a feel-good byword in our day; denoting freedom is something whatever one believes is appropriate for them. The truest meaning, the one America's Founding Fathers understood and conceived of for this great Republic, has now been relegated to the past I fear, lost in the shuffle of a progressive, perplexing, and troubled world which knows not the truth of our founding, neither the Almighty God who instituted the ideals of Liberty under God. Come along with me on an amazing journey as we navigate the waters of the past, looking into America's astonishing history, unrevised, unadulterated, and revealed without apology. We will find the truth together, and those who recall, they shall remember, and they who do not know, then shall they know. \"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?\" (Psalms 11:3, <em>KJV</em>) I shall be drawing from Holy Scriptures, and from my book throughout. The book is <em>Americans We Were</em>. I am Henry Thomas Weber. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Americans-Were-Henry-Thomas-Weber/dp/B0C1JK6NSZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HWU65AS8MUW2&amp;keywords=americans+we+were+henry+thomas+weber&amp;qid=1687145591&amp;sprefix=americans+we%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-1\">Americans We Were: Weber, Henry Thomas</a></p>",

        "description": "<p><em>Antediluvian Revelations </em>is a series of podcasts that presents the ancient <em>Book of Enoch</em> in a poetic format. The first episode is the introduction to the series, which explains the origination of the text and the poetic concept applied to retelling the story. Although it may actually predate the writings of Moses, <em>The Book of Enoch</em> was not included in the canonized Holy Bible, the most well-known religious text in the world, but the text has been considered one of the Kabbalah texts, which is ancient sect of Judaism that professed the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p><p>There are five parts of the poem, and each part is followed by a discussion episode that provides the literary analysis and critical thinking of the author about the poetry and its content. The full text may be available for download as a PDF in the near future for paid subscribers, and this podcast version is based upon the third edition of the manuscript dated 1 March 2023. Episodes will be released weekly. The final episode of Part One will be released on 5 August. Including the introduction episode, the total number of episodes will be 21: Season One is Part One with six episodes, Season Two is Part Two with six episodes, Season Three consists of Part Three, Four, and five with nine episodes. The third season has shorter episodes than the first two seasons, so the three parts will run consecutively instead of being separated into different seasons.</p><p>Be sure to follow or subscribe to receive notifications of newly released episodes as they become available.

Temos aqui a hist\u00f3ria do Esp\u00edrito \u00c1rtemis, que abre m\u00e3o de sua condi\u00e7\u00e3o feliz no mundo espiritual para ajudar antigos afetos, numa reencarna\u00e7\u00e3o dif\u00edcil, n\u00e3o por d\u00e9bito, mas por amor. Mostra a vida de ren\u00fancia deste Esp\u00edrito, numa pequena cidade do interior da Bahia, frente \u00e0s obsess\u00f5es perniciosas, enfermidades como a hansen\u00edase e dores morais superlativas, a fim de promover a reden\u00e7\u00e3o do seu cl\u00e3.

How might we anchor our souls in serene harbor during the fiercest of storms? How does one seek the sanctuary of serenity amidst the maelstroms of life? The \"Gate of Trust\" beckons us, guiding our souls on a divine odyssey towards an unwavering trust in the omnipotent and merciful embrace of Hashem. Immersed in this revered tome, we are shown the way to navigate life's unpredictable tides with an enduring and profound trust in the Almighty.</p><p>(Live recordings of my classes - streamed by the Jewish Education Centre Chabad Berlin, among others).</p>",

An manchen Tagen tanzen unsere Seelen zu den melodischen Rhythmen des Judentums und der Spiritualit\u00e4t, und an anderen Tagen finden sie Trost in den einfacheren Freuden des Lebens. Man kann sich fragen, wie ein vom g\u00f6ttlichen Funken ber\u00fchrtes Herz jemals nach irdischen Sehns\u00fcchten verlangen kann. Mit Anmut leuchtet der Tanya in das komplizierte Geflecht unserer Seele und enth\u00fcllt unser dualistisches Wesen. Durch ihre Weisheit navigieren wir durch die weiten Meere der t\u00e4glichen inneren Auseinandersetzungen. Auch wenn unser gesch\u00e4tzter Kodex des j\u00fcdischen Gesetzes den Bauplan des Lebens akribisch skizziert, bleibt eine tiefere Sehnsucht. Unsere Handlungen m\u00f6gen die g\u00f6ttlichen Weisungen widerspiegeln, doch es besteht eine Kluft: eine unber\u00fchrte Distanz zwischen unserem inneren Selbst und unserer heiligen Tora. Wie ein meisterhafter Architekt baut der Tanya eine Br\u00fccke zwischen der Seele und ihren frommen Bestrebungen. Sie formt unsere Tora und Mitzvot zu einer echten Reflexion unseres Wesens und erm\u00f6glicht es dem Herzen, wirklich mit dem Puls der j\u00fcdischen Identit\u00e4t zu schwingen. Aber wenn Sie sich auf den Weg machen, sollten Sie diese heiligen Wahrheiten bedenken: Der Tanja ist keine blo\u00dfe Schriftrolle, die man leichtfertig durchbl\u00e4ttert - sie verlangt Konzentration, Ehrfurcht und Hingabe. Er ist kein blo\u00dfes Gef\u00e4\u00df f\u00fcr fl\u00fcchtige Inspiration, ohne Geschichten oder w\u00f6chentliche Parscha-Perlen. Die Reise durch den Tanya ist keine fl\u00fcchtige Eskapade - sie erfordert aufrichtiges Engagement, eine ernsthafte Wanderung. Mehr als Worte ist der Tanya - ein Herzschlag, der jede Tora-Schriftrolle und jede Mitzwa rhythmisch mit Leben f\u00fcllt.</p><p>Live Mitschnitte meines Unterrichts - gestreamt u.a. von dem J\u00fcdischen Bildungszentrum Chabad Berlin.</p><p> </p><p>English: In the hallowed chambers of our sacred traditions, lies the Tanya \u2014 a gemstone of Chabad\u2019s age-old legacy. This opus, radiant with both mystic charm and practical wisdom, is the legacy of Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi (1745\u20131812), the luminous star of the Chabad-Lubavitch constellation.The Tanya's core echoes with humanity\u2019s profound query: Who are we amidst the ever-waxing and waning tides of faith? Some days, our souls dance to the melodic rhythms of Judaism and spirituality, and on others, they find solace in life's simpler pleasures. One may wonder, how can hearts touched by divine spark ever crave earthly desires?With grace, Tanya shines its guiding light upon our soul's intricate tapestry, unveiling our dualistic essence. Through its wisdom, we navigate the vast seas of daily internal skirmishes.While our cherished Code of Jewish Law meticulously sketches life's blueprint, there remains a deeper yearning. Our actions might mirror divine directives, yet there exists a chasm: an untouched distance between our inner self and our sacred Torah. Tanya, like a masterful architect, crafts a bridge between the soul and its devout aspirations. It molds our Torah and mitzvot into a genuine reflection of our essence, allowing the heart to genuinely resonate with the pulse of Jewish identity.  More than words, the Tanya is a heartbeat, rhythmically infusing life into every Torah scroll and mitzvah.</p><p>Live recordings of my classes - streamed by the Jewish Education Centre Chabad Berlin.</p>",

Von tiefgr\u00fcndigen theologischen \u00dcberlegungen bis hin zu den Feinheiten der j\u00fcdischen Philosophie, von den gefl\u00fcsterten Erz\u00e4hlungen der Tora und des Talmuds bis hin zu den mystischen Pfaden der Kabbala - Likkutei Sichos f\u00fchrt Sie durch die unz\u00e4hligen Dimensionen unseres Glaubens. Verwurzelt in der gesprochenen Weisheit, die Rabbi Schneerson \u00fcber die Jahreszeiten und heiligen Momente hinweg geteilt hat, umspannen diese Essays die weite Landschaft unserer Tage, angeordnet in \u00dcbereinstimmung mit den w\u00f6chentlichen Tora-Lesungen und den strahlenden Meilensteinen des j\u00fcdischen und chassidischen Kalenders. W\u00e4hrend der geweihten Versammlungen - den Farbrengen - am Schabbat und an den Festen, inmitten des rhythmischen Kalenders von Chabad Lubawitsch, teilte Rabbi Schneerson seinen endlosen Fluss der Weisheit, der stundenlang in aller Ruhe flie\u00dft. Unter den unz\u00e4hligen Echos seiner Worte fanden diejenigen, die am tiefsten nachhallten und die das Fundament seiner spirituellen Vision bildeten, ihren gesch\u00e4tzten Platz in den Likkutei Sichos. Diese Worte, die urspr\u00fcnglich w\u00f6chentliche Pergamente zierten, trugen die akribische Handschrift des Rebben, als er sie \u00fcberpr\u00fcfte und verfeinerte, bevor er sie der Welt schenkte. Rabbi Schneersons Verm\u00e4chtnis, ein kr\u00f6nendes Juwel im Wandteppich der chassidischen Geschichte, verk\u00f6rpert den Zenit des chassidischen Strebens: die verj\u00fcngenden Quellen des Chassidus weit und breit zu verbreiten und sie nahtlos mit den unz\u00e4hligen Schattierungen des Judentums zu verweben. In Likkutei Sichos findet man eine destillierte Essenz der Vision des Rebben, ein Zeugnis ihrer tiefen Tiefe und ihres Aufrufs zum Handeln.</p><p>Live Mitschnitte meines Unterrichts - gestreamt u.a. von dem J\u00fcdischen Bildungszentrum Chabad Berlin.</p><p>In the sacred annals of our age, \"Likkutei Sichos\" (Hebrew: \u05dc\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05d8\u05d9 \u05e9\u05d9\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea) stands as a luminous tapestry, weaving together the essence and expanse of teachings from the venerated Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. This collection serves as a beacon, illuminating Rabbi Schneerson's unparalleled insights into Judaism and the intricate dance of the universe.From profound theological ponderings to the intricacies of Jewish philosophy, from the whispered tales of the Torah and Talmud to the mystic trails of Kabbalah, Likkutei Sichos navigates the myriad dimensions of our faith. Rooted in the spoken wisdom shared by Rabbi Schneerson across seasons and sacred moments, these essays span the vast landscape of our days, arranged in alignment with the weekly Torah readings and the radiant milestones of Jewish and Hasidic calendars. It was during the sanctified gatherings \u2013 the farbrengens \u2013 on Shabbat and the festivals, amidst the rhythmic calendar of Chabad Lubavitch, that Rabbi Schneerson would share his endless river of wisdom, flowing unhurriedly for hours on end. Amongst the myriad echoes of his words, those that resonated most deeply, that formed the bedrock of his spiritual vision, found their cherished place in the Likkutei Sichos. These words, initially gracing weekly parchments, bore the Rebbe's meticulous touch as he reviewed and refined them before bestowing upon the world Rabbi Schneerson's legacy, a crowning jewel in the tapestry of Hasidic history, embodies the zenith of the Hasidic quest: to spread the rejuvenating springs of Chassidus far and wide, intertwining them seamlessly with the myriad hues of Judaism.

        "description": "<p>Rebbe und Chassid</p><p> </p><p>Im Herzen eines Chassid liegt eine tiefe Verbundenheit mit seinem Rebbe, ein Anker tief im weiten Ozean der chassidischen Tradition. Viele in der breiteren j\u00fcdischen Welt nehmen diese Verbindung mit einem getr\u00fcbten Blick wahr. Denn so wie die \u00e4therischsten Wahrheiten des Judentums oft in einem Schleier der R\u00e4tselhaftigkeit tanzen, so bleibt auch die Rolle eines Rebben f\u00fcr manche ein gefl\u00fcstertes Geheimnis, eine oft falsch geh\u00f6rte oder ganz und gar nicht gesungene Melodie. Wer also ist der Rebbe? Ein Tzaddik, der in Rechtschaffenheit erstrahlt? Eine Koryph\u00e4e im riesigen Universum der Tora? Ein Leuchtfeuer, das die Seelen entz\u00fcndet, das lenkt, erleuchtet und Trost spendet in den Pr\u00fcfungen des Lebens, sowohl des Geistes als auch des Herzens? Der Rebbe verk\u00f6rpert all dies und geht doch dar\u00fcber hinaus. Kein noch so gro\u00dfer Strau\u00df von Lobpreisungen kann die Essenz eines Rebben wirklich einfangen. Denn ein Rebbe ist ein Gef\u00e4\u00df, das mit g\u00f6ttlichem Licht \u00fcberstr\u00f6mt, ein seltenes Juwel, das der Allm\u00e4chtige in unsere Mitte stellt, Generation f\u00fcr Generation, und das ein Portal zu spirituellen Aussichten jenseits des gew\u00f6hnlichen j\u00fcdischen Horizonts bietet. In seinem Herzen hegt ein Rebbe keine irdischen Sehns\u00fcchte, au\u00dfer der Umarmung des G\u00f6ttlichen, dem Streben nach den Geboten der Tora und der F\u00fchrung der Seelen auf diesem heiligen Pfad. Das unterscheidet ihn selbst von den am meisten verehrten Tora-Gelehrten. Obwohl der Wandteppich der Chassidim reich und vielf\u00e4ltig ist, gewebt aus einzigartigen Traditionen und Br\u00e4uchen, gibt es einen goldenen Faden, der sie alle verbindet: das unnachgiebige Band zwischen den Chassidim und ihrem Rebbe. Aus Angst vor Parallelen zu anderen Glaubensrichtungen haben sich einige Juden, vielleicht aus Unwissenheit, manchmal von ihnen abgewandt oder sogar tiefe Wahrheiten, die in ihrem eigenen Erbe verwurzelt sind, in Frage gestellt. Wie, so fragen sie sich, kann ein Sterblicher in unserem direkten Bund mit dem G\u00f6ttlichen eine so verehrte Stellung einnehmen? Missverst\u00e4ndnisse \u00fcber dieses heilige Band, das B\u00fcndnis zwischen Rebbe und Chassid, und seine Bedeutung in der gro\u00dfen Erz\u00e4hlung des Judentums k\u00f6nnen zu falschen Vorstellungen f\u00fchren. Das Ziel dieses Bandes ist es, diesen Nebel zu vertreiben und das Verm\u00e4chtnis und die \u00fcberragende Rolle eines Rebben in der j\u00fcdischen Odyssee sowie seine tiefe Verwandtschaft mit seinen Sch\u00fclern zu beleuchten.</p><p>Live Mitschnitte meines Unterrichts - gestreamt u.a. von dem J\u00fcdischen Bildungszentrum Chabad Berlin.</p><p>In the heart of a Chassid, there lies a profound bond with their Rebbe, an anchor deep within the vast ocean of Chassidic tradition. Many, in the wider Jewish tapestry, perceive this tie with a clouded gaze. For just as the most ethereal truths of Judaism often dance in veils of enigma, so too does the role of a Rebbe remain a whispered secret to some, a melody often misheard or altogether unsung. So who, then, is the Rebbe? A tzaddik, resplendent in righteousness? A luminary of Torah's vast universe? A beacon who kindles souls, who steers, enlightens, and provides solace in life's trials, both of spirit and of heart? The Rebbe embodies all these and yet transcends them. No bouquet of praises, however grand, can truly capture the essence of a Rebbe. For a Rebbe is a vessel overflowing with Divine light, a rare gem that the Almighty sets amidst us, generation after generation, offering a portal to spiritual vistas beyond the ordinary Jewish horizon. ... Misunderstandings of this sacred bond, the Rebbe-chassid alliance, and its significance in Judaism's grand narrative can breed misconceptions. This tome's quest is to dispel these mists and shine a luminous beacon on the legacy and paramount role of a Rebbe in the Jewish odyssey and his deep kinship with his disciples.</p><p> </p><p>Live recordings of my classes - streamed by the Jewish Education Centre Chabad Berlin.</p>",

I am also a founder of Life with Terry - a coaching, wellness, &amp; education company established to help people create &amp; live a fulfilled life, create effectively &amp; efficiently , and embark on a life journey of Self-discovery, Self-development &amp; Self-healing.</p><p><strong>PURPOSE OF PODCAST</strong></p><p>This podcast was created to talk about religion, indoctrination, colonisation and brain washing &amp; reversal thereof. I use the word <em>Self </em>to refer to the original version of the body, the spirt, mind and soul before colonisation, indoctrination and brain washing caused by religion.</p><p>I was indoctrinated, colonised and brainwashed for decades by Christian religion, from the time I was born until 2019 when I embarked on a beautiful journey of Self-discovery, Self-development &amp; Self-healing. Since then I have never looked back.</p><p>The decolonisation of the faith-based religion, surprisingly led to further decolonisation of multiple non-faith based religions and human made systems that unfortunately limit our abilities to find and manifest Self.</p><p>This podcast is one of the platforms that I will use to manifest the undeniable deep calling of sharing my journey, enlightening &amp; healing others as we raise the individual &amp; collective consciousness of the human race. The podcast will help you create &amp; live a fulfilled life, create effectively &amp; efficiently, embark on life journey of Self-discovery, Self-development &amp; Self-healing.</p><p>There is no better time than now. What a time to be alive, in the presence of a powerful force filled with the energy of truth &amp; healing of human race.</p><p>The ultimate goal of this podcast is to help my non-indoctrinated listeners to understand the impact of religion on a human being &amp; find better ways to relate with those who are indoctrinated. It is also to enlighten my listeners who are colonised and brainwashed, to remember who they are, heal &amp; restore themselves from multiple traumas caused by religion.</p><p>May you find healing, freedom, peace, joy, happiness, love, health, light &amp; every positive energy that you can think, raise your consciousness of as we embark on this beautiful journey together. May you connect with Self and become the creator that you are destined to become.</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.lifewithterry.com\">https://www.lifewithterry.com</a></p><p><strong>NB! </strong>Please note that episodes 3-8 were moved from the Podcast Life with Terry @ <a href=\"https://rss.com/podcasts/lifewithterry/\">https://rss.com/podcasts/lifewithterry/</a>.</p><p>We are also pleased to announce that we have a new Podcast dedicated to the subject matter of Principles &amp; Tools of Creation.
