Vanuit deze wortels zoeken we constant naar manieren om kunst en maatschappij met elkaar te verbinden, met als kloppend hart onze community in de broedplaats. We zijn verbonden met elkaar door kunst, maar ook door eten en gezelligheid.\n\nWe verbinden op een laagdrempelige manier de onderwerpen en theorie\u00ebn die ons inspireren met het alledaagse en herkenbare. We werken vanuit de overtuiging dat kunst ons kan helpen om na te denken over nieuwe manieren om de wereld te bekijken en in te richten. Graag gaan we zelfs nog een stap verder dan hierover nadenken, en proberen we de idee\u00ebn die we bespreken ook dagelijks in de praktijk te brengen. We verzetten ons tegen de patriarchale norm die in onze maatschappij nog steeds leidend is, en stellen in plaats daarvan collectiviteit, waardering, zorg, overleg en emotie centraal. Daarbij haken we aan op actuele onderwerpen, zoals kapitalisme, feminisme en digitale cultuur, en zijn we niet bang om mee te veranderen met de tijd.",

Zowel in deze podcast als in het museum willen we laten zien hoe kunst en geschiedenis ons wereldbeeld kleuren. Met de tentoonstelling De Pest (2021) werden de eerste podcasts gemaakt. In dit eerste seizoen nemen diverse experts je mee door de geschiedenis van deze bijzondere infectieziekte. Hoe heeft de pest zijn sporen nagelaten in kunst en cultuur? En wat zijn de paralellen met de coronacrisis? Een jaar later was het tijd voor een nieuwe, relevante, tentoonstelling: Moving Stories: de Rijkdom van de Limes. Met deze tentoonstelling worden de migratieverhalen van  2000 jaar geleden gekoppeld met migratieverhalen van nu. Als voorbereiding op de tentoonstelling spraken de curatoren van de expositie, Marie Stel en Marenne Zandstra met een groep mensen die in de regio woont en een migratieachtergrond heeft: het public-in-residence. Ook sprak het public-in-residence, de mensen met een migratieachtergrond dus, met hedendaagse kunstenaars, die naar aanleiding van die gesprekken nieuw werk maakten voor de tentoonstelling. Een gedeelte van die gesprekken kan je horen in het tweede seizoen van de podcast.  ",

In each episode we focus our conversation on a single photograph by the artist. From there, I try to let the artist shape the conversation, and what has emerged are nine episodes (so far) that can be used as a teaching tool, or a course in itself about how to look at photographs and look \u201cwith care.\u201d Each episode ends with a praxis assignment, visual exercise, or creative prompt for students or listeners. I am looking forward to sharing them with you.\n\n\u201cThe Careful Photograph\u201d is made possible by the MCSI at Pitzer College. As Director of the Monroe Center for Social inquiry this public podcast will serve as a companion to my MCSI course offering, \u201cPhotography and the Racialized Body,\u201d a course which stems from my own long engagement with questions of identity, the body, and the history of photography and race in America.",

What comes after the &amp;\u2026 can\u2019t be prescribed and each episode is framed by speakers through their choice of title. Through informal dialogue we hope to create space for key voices in the archive to rise to the surface, and to provide a platform for artists to define themselves without a pre-determined agenda. Our conversations touch on the experience of building an archive from a practical and psychological perspective and explore parts of artists\u2019 lives and work that may not have been shared publicly in the past.

When you sync up the mind, heart, and spirit, it unlocks a whole new world. Welcome to the adventure of YOUR lifetime.  It's time to listen... doodle... and shine!\n \nSpoken Art Journaling is designed to be both meditative and mind blowing. Three years ago, Molly caught her husband staring out into space and thought for sure he must be thinking of something earth shattering. Nope! When asked what he was thinking about, he responded with, \u201cNothing.\u201d Astonished at how a person could do such a thing, his comment put her on a journey of quiet time and self-discovery. What she discovered is that thinking about nothing was not her jam. She realized that allowing her mind to express itself through color and the impressions all around her (inside & out), tapped into her heart and spirit too. She coined the technique Spoken Art Journaling and 8 journals later, she\u2019s a happier & healthier person because of it. \n\nMolly Nece is CEO of GOLDEN Age Leadership (.com) and dabbles in the spirituality side of life at MollySHINES.com. She believes every person drives results and deserves to shine. Reach out to Molly for help mining your gold--it doesn't always mean dollars and it doesn't always make sense.\n",

In addition to various topics related to language, one of the goals of this podcast is comfort in listening to broken English.\n\nIn different episodes, we explore topics such as: What is 'broken' in the way we speak and for whom is 'broken', second language, native languages, \"pollution\" of English as an act of protest, class-related aspects of language, purity in language, writing, proofreading, and to what extent we should correct ourselves. We allow ourselves to go in different directions, such as humor, work, immigration, displacement or deal with topics from different regions of the world. \nAnd last but not least: we do not apologize for our broken English. \n\nEmail: podcast.brokenenglish@gmail.com\nInstgram: @brokenenglish_podcast\nCover design by Uro\u0161 Pajovi\u0107\nSound: Nikola Kekerovic\n",

Art that works and reaches us does not necessitate that we be aware of the artist or source of the work. Each person is able to communicate freely with the work of the artist.

        "description": "Design is Not Neutral is a podcast built from a thesis project. As a present design master's student at the University of Notre Dame, I began a broader inquiry into the way design as a field was built and the way we now teach design. After doing more research, it became clear - that design in the United States has a diversity problem. The roots of our diversity issue are squarely in how we define and teach Graphic Design. Graphic Design was made for white, cis-gendered, able-bodied men in consumer-driven societies. With this foundation, how we determine what is \u2018good design\u2019 has become extremely exclusionary. Yet, despite increased conversation around equity, design education has yet to dramatically change. The designers and design educators interviewed on Design is Not Neutral have all deeply researched the field of design education in order to improve our field. This podcast will not only provide listeners with resources on how to challenge their own perceptions of what design has been defined by, it will also provide concrete examples of how this work is being done in classrooms. I hope you enjoy each conversation as much as I did and if you liked Design is Not Neutral please check us out on Instagram.",

Loss, in this context, is viewed as an inevitable part of life and a prism through which we explore artistic practice and expression. \n \nSophia is interested in building a space where creatives can openly discuss their observations, their stories and the resulting strategies in order to alleviate isolation, make broader connections and create a supportive community. \n\n\nWebsite here https://www.sophandson.com/\nPatreon: https://www.sophandson.com/whereartandgriefmeet \nPaypal: https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8L9Ak8pJu3\n\n",

In doing so, artists may expand their audiences and listeners may feel inspired to start creating and minting art of their own. Every episode is recorded via a live Twitter Space where attendees have an opportunity to ask the guest artist questions. This is a very inclusive space welcoming artists of all nationalities, backgrounds and artistic styles. Whether they have a huge following or are just starting their career, all are welcome.
