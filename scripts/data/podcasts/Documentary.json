        "title": "With One Tied Hand - The Buffalo Soldiers of World War II",
        "description": "Though veterans of the United States of America liberated others worldwide at immense sacrifice, a little told American story is the unique liberation of the Tuscan people by the Buffalo Soldiers of WWII. After the War ended, these courageous men were sent home to a 'Jim Crow' America. \n\nItalian history is strikingly different. The impoverished, starving Tuscans feel as if they owe their lives to the Buffalo Soldiers, whom they lovingly dubbed 'Giganti Buoni' (Good Giants). An Italian eyewitness said, \u201cThey came down the mountain and freed us, and took care of us.\u201d \n\nIvan J. Houston, who was himself wounded in WWII, served in the Segregated 92nd Infantry Division, which bravely fought and pushed the German Nazis and Italian Fascists back behind  The Gothic Line. Tragically, these \"Black Warriors\" were also forced to fight the U.S. Army\u2019s institutionalized racism, and even individual racist White officers who did not want them to succeed.\n\n\u201cThat was just the way the Army was,\u201d says Mr. Houston, retired CEO of America\u2019s third largest African American-owned corporation. \n\nBetween 1945 and 2011, Mr. Houston returned many times to Italy, meeting the Pope, revisiting his battlefields of old, and honoring his fallen comrades at the Florence-American Cemetery. Then, after writing the book, \"Black Warriors: The Buffalo Soldiers of WWII, with Gordon Cohn, Mr. Houston was introduced by chance to many, many Italian Reenactors who treated him with warmth and respect. Through the hospitality of a gracious Italian woman, Mattea Piazzesi, a unique bond was formed between two families, the Houston's and the Piazzesi's. Ms Piazzesi had discovered Mr. Houston via his book.\n\nMr. Houston investigated missing casualty records with the help of local historians, who found the culprit was General Edward Almond, the racist commander (a fact acknowledged by the U.S. War College), who sent an African American Regiment into deadly battle without warning them to expect a heavy Nazi attack. This caused heavy casualties, which Almond then covered up. \n\nThe documentary film, \"With One Tied Hand\" tells the stirring story of how Tuscan gratitude is finally shown to Mr. Houston, who on behalf of all Buffalo Soldiers is paraded and celebrated on a loving, yearly reenactment of the Liberation of Lucca, the 500-year-old walled city. The film also reveals moving personal stories from surviving eyewitnesses and their families. \n\n\u201cI think this is the only instance in history where African-Americans have liberated another people,\u201d Mr. Houston concludes.",

Her activism fostered Supreme Court cases which sparked the US environmental justice movement, but after a decade of leading the fight, she vanished in 2001. \n\nAfter nearly twenty years of lurking in the shadows, Zulene resurfaces in 2019. She connects with a local podcaster to not only tell her story, but make one thing abundantly clear: she will reclaim Chester\u2019s right to breathe.\n",

It's a chance to soak up the ambiance of the world's greatest watering holes without leaving your home.\n\nI\u2019m Richard Crouse. I tended bar for seventeen years everywhere from hot spots to dive bars and I thought I had seen it all.\n\nIn my life behind bars I witnessed everything from first dates and marriage proposals to knife fights and a woman who brought a pet monkey in for a drink.\n\nNothing could surprise me.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThen I heard about how a lion who visited Harry\u2019s New York Bar in Paris inspired Ernest Hemingway to write one of his greatest novels. And why there are century old chicken bones hanging above the beer-stained bar at McSorleys in New York City. And how Vincent Sardi refused to do business with the mob during Prohibition, so his famous Broadway Restaurant didn\u2019t serve alcohol until the 21st amendment passed, six year after they first opened.\n\nWith the help of the Last Call radio players, music and interviews with cocktail detectives Jared Brown and Anistatia Miller, The Indiana Jones of Tiki, Jeff \u201cBeachbum\u201d Berry and Two and Two: McSorley's, My Dad, and Me author Rafe Bartholomew, I bring these stories, and many more, to life in my podcast Last Call. It\u2019s fact folded in with a sprinkling of fiction, because, well, who doesn\u2019t exaggerate after a few drinks?\n\nSo, open that bottle of wine or crack that beer and join me for an intoxicating guided tour of some of the strange stories from some of the world\u2019s best boozers.",

The city of South Gate is considered one of the most environmentally burdened communities in the state of California. This mini podcast series explores the many environmental hazards in the area including \u201cThe Brown Water Issue,\u201d hazardous waste threats from many fronts including the Exide Battery facility, air pollution, and limited open/green space access. As climate change continues to progress, the urban heat island effect will only exacerbate and add to existing burdens. Covid-19 has further revealed and reinforced the dire need to address and take action on these environmental injustices. ",

        "description": "Distilled California began as a joke. A historian and a distiller walk into a tasting room. What do they do? The historian says to the other. Do you know the story of the liquor that's in that glass? \"No,\" says the distiller, do you know how it got into the glass in the first place? Do you know what it takes? \"No,\" says the historian. And the rest is well...\n\nDistilled California is the distiller-driven podcast for the booze nerd. Join hosts Dylan Almendral and Ryan Freisen as we take a deep dive into the bottle. We discuss the history, legends, politics and future of the California distilling industry from the ground up and distill what it means to be grain to glass in California. Ryan is a distiller and Vice President of the California Artisanal Distillers Guild. Dylan is a historian and writer. Both are devout students and stewards of the glass. This show exists to create informed drinkers. If you drink, know what's in your bottle! And, of course, to document the California distillery world while it is in its infancy. \nThis podcast is for everyone; the aficionado, the vaguely interested, the distiller, the historian and the nerd alike. All are welcome and always will be. We all float down here. \n\nThe podcast will feature tastings, science, history, interviews with distillers, book reviews, distributors, and of course, good times. \n\nJoin us as we learn and pass on the experience to you! \n\nPlease LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE AND SUBSCRIBE\n",

        "description": "<p>They found their sister's sneaker near a wooden fence. There was no note, visible sign of a struggle or an accident. But a 10-year-old girl who lived a serene, happy life disappeared in August 1993 while on vacation at her grandparent's house in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. On that horrible day, she and her baby brother took a 5-minute walk to see a litter of collie puppies play on a neighbor's property. Her brother returned home shortly afterward, leaving his sister alone. Then she was gone. No one saw what happened. Or so it seems.</p><p>Just before her disappearance, about 200 yards away, a man in a pickup truck leered at two teen girls, terrifying them as they checked their mailbox. They feared he was about to grab one of them. Holly Piirainen's remains were found 79 days later in the woods about nine miles away. The medical examiner marked it a homicide.</p><p>A team of retired investigators believes the man in the pickup is responsible for the abduction and murder of Holly, but her case is still unsolved. Three decades later, Holly's story has never been told in its entirety. With the cooperation of Holly's family, I decided to tackle the story of what happened that day. Let's discover what we know and don't know and who are the persons of interest. And...let\u2019s be prepared to uncover some new details along the way.</p><p>MEDIA INQUIRIES ONLY: Contact Richard Price: <a href=\"mailto:shortwalkmedia1@gmail.com\">shortwalkmedia1@gmail.com</a>; (508) 614-9367\u202c</p>",

        "description": "L\u2019idea del podcast nasce qualche mese fa, dopo una chiacchierata con Mirko Romanato del Centro Sudi Ettore Luccini. Egli mi esortava a proporre qualcosa al Centro, lasciandomi carta bianca sull\u2019argomento cos\u00ec pure sul mezzo con cui veicolarlo. Ne \u00e8 nata l\u2019idea di proporre una serie di puntate che avessero come filo rosso la storia delle donne in Italia a cavallo delle trasformazioni sociali e culturali degli anni Sessanta e Settanta. Ogni racconto pu\u00f2 essere ascoltato singolarmente o costituire un tassello della storia complessiva, che non si pretende esaustiva -capirete, il tema \u00e8 vastissimo- ma teso a offrire degli spunti di riflessione e fare luce su un tempo storico ricco di eventi che hanno ricadute profonde nel presente.\nLe storie che ho proposto fin qui, derivano dai miei precedenti studi sulla storia delle donne nel secondo Novecento. Come spiego all\u2019interno del podcast, il momento su cui mi concentro sono in particolare gli anni in cui iniziano a manifestarsi i primi segnali di una stagione di grandi trasformazioni che investono il privato e dunque il modo di fare famiglia, la vita domestica e le relazioni familiari. Il problema del contrasto fra tradizione e modernit\u00e0 in ordine al comportamento femminile \u00e8 uno dei nodi problematici del periodo, sollevato ad esempio dalla stampa: penso alle vicende che hanno per protagonista la giovane Franca Viola, il caso del giornalino scolastico \u00abLa zanzara\u00bb, il modo in cui sono ritratte le ragazze dei movimenti. \nI movimenti studenteschi e operai del biennio \u201968-69 e il movimento femminista che comincia a costituirsi rendono vivo il tema delle rivendicazioni dal basso con una carica cui le istituzioni non possono pi\u00f9 essere totalmente sorde. L\u2019apporto dei movimenti \u00e8 stato determinante per la volont\u00e0 di delegittimare i modelli etici e culturali vigenti, soprattutto sul piano dei rapporti tra i sessi, dei sentimenti, della sessualit\u00e0 e della famiglia. \n\nTitoli delle puntate:\n1- L'Italia che cambia (oppure Come cambia l'Italia dopo il boom)\n2-Le italiane si confessano\n3- La ragazza che disse no\n4- Arriva il divorzio\n5- Alla scoperta del corpo (delle donne)",

        "description": "Punjabi Lehar is endeavoring to bridge a gap between the people of East and West Punjab, created by the partition of 1947. Most of the people have passed away with an unfulfilled ardent desire in their heart, to see their birth place and meet their childhood friends. Punjabi Lehar is attempting to fufil the desire of remaining partition era punjabis, who will be gone in the next five to seven years. Punjabi Lehar, through its medium is spreading the message of love and cooperation. With your support, It will always be our endeavor to create an environment for communication, love and harmony",

        "description": "\u201cWho Holds up Half the Sky\u201d is an investigative podcast discussing the possibilities of advancing feminist activism in China under censorship and lack of free speech. Influential activist figures appear in China\u2019s history from the Qing dynasty to the Maoist era with its famous quote: \u201cWomen Hold up Half the Sky\u201d. But Chinese women have undergone much pressure from foot binding and arranged marriages to unequal pay and domestic violence. Over the years, I have dived deeper into issues of multiculturalism, social activism, and gender identities. This work defines my curiosity which stems from a continuous movement through distinct cultural spaces, which started in China.\n\nYou can read more about the podcast, and the research for it, as well as listen to the full interviews and the full-length podcast here: andreeacoscai.com/2020/09/09/sound-projects/\n\nCover art by Meaghan Paine\nMixing by Jullian Androkae",

        "description": "Women in Action was an arts and heritage project, led by Collective Encounters in 2020-2022, that used drama and creativity to celebrate women\u2019s resilience, activism and community organising across Merseyside. The Ballad of 18 Women is the major final outcome of the project, incorporating testimonies recorded in oral history interviews as well as poetic narration and original music and song. \n\nThis radio ballad highlights the stories of 18 Merseyside women to give an insight into the incredible contributions women make every day to improve lives in our region. Woven together, they give a glimpse of the multitude of positive actions that hold, nurture and empower our communities.\n\nThe 18 women share a concern for fairness and social justice, but their causes, actions and impacts are many and varied. Some would not consider themselves to be \u2018activists\u2019, but all have given of themselves to help others and in doing that have made the world a better place. The radio ballad pulls some common threads from their stories; the archive collection (available online or on request) offers the full recording for each person, showing the richness of their individual contributions.\n\nWe hope the ballad and recordings will inspire new women activists, as well as sustain, celebrate and encourage those who are already working for change: it is a homage to these 18 women and to you.\n\nWritten by Sarah Thornton\nComposed by Bethany Kay Hopkins\nDirected by Tessa Buddle\nSound Design by Karen Lauke\nArtwork by Doriscakes Creates\n\nFeaturing the voices of: \nAlma Brown, Anna Reid, Anne Gorton, Anya Chapman, Chantelle Lunt, Clara Paillard, Doreen McNally, Felicity Dowling, Imogen Woolley, Johanna Schweier, June Hudson, Keith Barber, Libby Mackay, Lois Woolley, Lynda Cash, Maddy Vaz, Margaret Mariette, Mary O\u2019Sullivan, Olivia Graham, Terri Heldt, Tracey Dunn, Zi Lan Liao\n\nFor more information about Women in Action visit: https://collective-encounters.org.uk/projects/women-in-action/\n\nTo explore the full interviews with the 18 women visit: https://audio.maydayrooms.org/the-ballad-of-18-women \n\nMade possible with funding from National Lottery Heritage Fund, PH Holt Foundation, LCVS, Arts Council England, and Liverpool City Council; archived in partnership with the Museum of Liverpool and MayDay Radio.",

We will dive into random topics and stories to explain some of the intricate processes we have in our society, or just to talk about random things that we think are interesting. Kory will objectively research and present, mostly in rant form coupled with humor, the information he has learned during the research process. Topics will vary tremendously as we scour the internet's information and put to use the fact that we have the ability to learn almost anything if we take the time to look it up. Mostly, we are just going to hang out and bullshit around while hopefully obtaining some form of interesting though probably useless knowledge or we will just have some fun...either way. ",

Loss, in this context, is viewed as an inevitable part of life and a prism through which we explore artistic practice and expression. \n \nSophia is interested in building a space where creatives can openly discuss their observations, their stories and the resulting strategies in order to alleviate isolation, make broader connections and create a supportive community. \n\n\nWebsite here https://www.sophandson.com/\nPatreon: https://www.sophandson.com/whereartandgriefmeet \nPaypal: https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8L9Ak8pJu3\n\n",

The Care Home Option series provides listeners with both practical and general information. Whilst issues concerning regulations and fees are specific to England, most issues discussed are relevant to anyone considering care and support for themselves or a loved one, anywhere in the world.\n\nGabriella has worked to improve the quality (and equality) of life for those living and working in care homes, and presents an in-depth and holistic view of the sector, to offset the mostly one-sided reporting in the media.\nDrew who is the creator, producer and co-host of the series asks the questions he feels would be helpful for himself and the listeners.\n\nWe are very grateful to all those who supported us during the making of these podcasts, especially to our expert guest speakers - Jonathan West, Romy Pikoos, and Padraic Garrett. To Caroline and Richard for sharing their personal experiences of care and to Daniella Wills, Paula Madden and Shelley Fish for their feedback, and to Shelley Wills Designs for the creation of the logo. \n\nThe full version of the lullaby played throughout the series Co-written and Produced by Drew can be heard and seen at www.bettyndrew.com\n\nEpisode Program, to be released over a number of weeks.\n\nTrailer\n\nEpisode 1 - Care homes; an overview.\n\nEpisode 2 - Choosing and preparing for a care home.\n\nEpisode 3 - Costs, fees and legal matters.

        "description": "<p>Much like Shakespeare or Homer, Les Propheties de M. Michel Nostradamus, also known as the Prophecies of Michel Nostradamus, reads like poetry but is actually an epic saga. It\u2019s out of sequence, broken up into 942 pieces and mixed up like a jigsaw puzzle. With the jigsaw puzzle being a picture of a Labyrinth, the book poses problems but makes requests to raise awareness in an effort to create a different outcome. Skeptics will say that Les Propheties predicts too much Doom, but then why does one get insurance or prepare for calamity. Because concern should drive us into action and not passivity or depression. Nostradamus has given warnings and explanations for you in simple, easy to understand four line poems known as quatrains and once you learn to read them you can solve the puzzle. Skeptics will say you can interpret anything you want into the Prophecies of Nostradamus and that they are quite vague and intentionally that way to be able to fit general circumstances. Not true, if you understand how the Oracle works and that Nostradamus explained this in the Preface to his book of prophecies. That the vast majority of quatrains cannot be solved until after they have occurred is consistent with how the Oracle works. This leads you to learn the language so that you are able to solve the quatrains that remain, which are the main quatrains that pertain to what the book is about. There is one major prophecy that Nostradamus is making, the rest of the quatrains are merely proof of where he got the information. Each quatrain in the book of prophecies is not so much a prediction as it is a set of details about an event that took place in European history as well as events that affected the entire world from the year 1555 till the year 3797. Essentially saying to you all that he read your news and that's how he knows about this ultimately devastating chain of events; all of which can be avoided. Nostradamus laments in the Preface about the many \u201cmen of letters and letters\u201d that will come along to make boastful claims of slander and bear false witness against him in an effort to sell books. He also expresses in the Epistle to King Henry II, his continual prayer to God asking that some people will come along to his Aid and Defense. Now that could be you once you have learned to read the quatrains. Nostradamus refers to this as the period when ignorance has been overcome, which needs to be now. The book doesn't only offer warnings, it also offers solutions. Nostradamus asks you to turn anxiety and reluctance into determination and action. Listen along to understand what it's about and why the book has never gone out of print for all of these years to make it into your hands now. The most famous of the Gothic writers from the European continent, Michel Nostradamus gives you the greatest literary work of prophetic wisdom to come out of medieval Europe. One of the secrets to the success of Les Propheties is rooted in the dark visionary style of his writing and how the quatrains actually create raw visuals in your mind. It was created as a word game after all because he knew people would remain more interested in that. Nostradamus insists that he is not a prophet and that he is a sinner like any man lacking perfection but he was given this information because he was at the right place at the right time. And the poetry? Well that was divine inspiration. History doesn't repeat itself, people repeatedly make the same mistakes because those who don\u2019t study history are condemned to repeat it. Just keep going, strive on untiringly. It is in the doing that you will find yourself and the answers you need. Nostradamus says it's so! Love righteousness and hate inequity...while always remembering, there can be no truth entirely determined concerning the future. It's about what you do now; that's what determines the future.</p>",

Documenting where we have been and the pieces that make us who we are today, as well as what comes our way as we go along. Join us on our journey.\n\nAs true natives of the Asheville NC area, the Howard family have raised generations in WNC. In 2012, they decided to start what was to become Asheville's first proper distillery to distill gin and rum since prohibition. With careful planning, research & development, and a burning desire to see Asheville become not just a beer mecca, but a craft beverage mecca, a distillery that would beckon curious drinkers far and wide was born.\nA vision to bring a craft spirit with class to the table would soon become reality.\nOver the years the vision has expanded to share the Cultivated Lifestyle. A new way to enjoy the distillery experience was created. From grain to garnish, Cultivated Cocktails takes you from the distillation process through the cocktail creation.",

        "description": "<p>What was THAT? This podcast will focus on survival and pushing forward after life events, tragic or not. Life after illness, Life after abuse, Life after a career, Life after whatever else happens! Season 1 focuses on the survivors of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)--widows, widowers, partners, friends, siblings, children, etc. Each of our participants will have 2 episodes, the first being their story--Life AFTER the diagnosis, the onslaught of the changing dynamics of the disease, and how it changed relationships, and life. The second episode for each story will focus on Life After THAT monster and how they are moving on or not and what might help themselves and others. In other words, how are they now carrying on? ALS is considered rare, yet it kills tens of thousands in the United States annually and many more worldwide. Most ALS patients live 2-5 years from diagnosis, but not all. Regardless, the body movements die off while the mind usually stays vibrant. Most of those affected wouldn\u2019t wish the disease on their worst enemy and would actually prefer cancer over ALS...because except in rare cases, there\u2019s at least a chance to survive with the other. In either case, loved ones are changed forever, and suffer from PTSD, depression, etc. The importance of spreading awareness of the disease is important, but so is acknowledging what the caretakers and loved ones have been through. This season provides that opportunity, a sounding board if you will, and hopefully what my late husband, also a victim of ALS, encouraged...\u201dKeep on keepin\u2019 on because being sad or mad will not do you any good. Be happy.\u201d</p>",

Markham Hill contains 300 acres of intact, urban forest and natural areas, several Pratt family-built structures, at least two Native American sites, and has a history of cultural importance to the area, including a boys &amp; girls camp from the 1920s-1940s, hippies and students living in the abandoned camp cabins from the 1950s-2000s, over 40 years of University of Arkansas runners on the trails, wildlife studies, horseback riding, bird walks, etc. However, developers have bought almost half of the mountain so far and plan to deforest and develop it. Friends of Markham Hill is a grass roots effort to save Markham Hill from deforestation and development. But we need help spreading the word and using public pressure to protect this land. This podcast contains at least 80 'Weekly Markham Hill Moments of History' that were initially posted on Facebook, sent to the Fayetteville City Council, and aired on Fayetteville's KPSQ 97.3 FM Community Radio. So far, the developers and Big Money are winning. They have started deforesting. Please share this podcast and help spread the word. Thank you so much. Let's save Markham Hill!</p>",

As investigators feverishly search for clues, the narrative swiftly evolves into a complex tapestry of characters with conflicting testimonies. With each twist and turn, the audience is drawn deeper into the shadowy corners of the victims' lives and a labyrinth of potential suspects. Through riveting storytelling, meticulous evidence analysis, and insightful expert perspectives, listeners are immersed in the investigation. Firsthand interviews are expertly woven together to vibrantly portray the victims' personas, lurking motives, and law enforcement's unyielding quest for justice. As the series unfolds, we are presented with a spectrum of viewpoints - from the relentless efforts of law enforcement and forensic experts to the harrowing experiences of friends and family forever marked by this tragedy. Amid these narratives, more prominent themes begin to emerge, which probe the essence of justice, the weight of communal bonds, and the ceaseless pursuit of truth. This true crime saga transcends a mere crime to solve as it morphs into a profound exploration of human behavior under duress, the resilience of people grappling with sorrow, and the extremes one will traverse in their quest for answers and closure. With each unfolding chapter, the sequence of events seamlessly guides us through a labyrinthine path of raw emotion as the intricate layers of the investigation peel away. Along the way, we are tempted, rather beseeched, to confront the shadows that linger beneath the veneer of our own lives.</p><p>Produced, Written &amp; Edited by Cory Zimmerman.</p><p>Produced by August Olsen of Lone Bird Media.</p><p>Research by Jinra Ilustrisimo, Anna Maria Cannon &amp; Chelseah Mesa.</p><p>Contact SRG at: <a href=\"mailto:cz@studios.works\">cz@studios.works</a>.</p><p>Visit SRG at: <a href=\"http://www.spoonrivergothic.com\">www.spoonrivergothic.com</a>.</p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/srg.podcast/\">@srg.podcast</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SRG_Presents\">@srg.presents</a></p><p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Spoon.River.Gothic.Podcast\">/Spoon.River.Gothic.Podcast</a></p><p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsiq77HC2lxMWECYPIwHlng\">@Spoon.River.Gothic.Podcast</a></p>",

They went down a path of using illegal means to survive but switched courses after a few years. That switch changed their lives forever. They are now famous youtube stars with over 7 million youtube subscribers and over 1billion views across channels. Their past life unfortunately caught up with them, landing them both in federal prison. They did their time, paid their debt to society and are now sharing their experience with the world; in hope to help people going through legal, financial or relationship issues. They are very raw on their podcast, unlike their known Youtube persona which is family friendly. Join Billy &amp; Eva on BE Unfiltered.</p>",

Most people by doing simple mind hacks are able to achieve all material success and seemingly peaceful, joyful, prosperous life believing that God made human beings to be as gods, to create their own destiny and manifest it but when the time comes to leave everything behind they learn that their belief and faith in the self was vain and their belief and faith in God was one-sided. </p></li><li><p>This world taught them to serve God in their own way but bible says your righteousness is like filthy rags unto me. Lucifer chose to serve God in his own way hence he was banished from heaven and the earth was given to him. He is the god of this world and Christ is his replacement, who is with God right now. Christ chooses to serve God how God wants him to hence God is in Christ. Lucifer hates this! So he decided to hide the truth. Lucifer is Anti-Christ and he has blinded people.</p></li><li><p>Jesus and Christ are two seperate beings. Jesus is a soul and Christ is a spirit. Jesus is the son of David and Christ our Lord God is the son of God. Jesus was not in Genesis. Jesus became Jesus Christ - a son of God.</p></li><li><p>If you have read this so far it means you are seeking and here comes your answer.

        "description": "<p>No Justice No Peace: The Survival of a Mother &amp; Son in a Broken System Based on the True Story of Sarah Nazorek and her son Alexander Landon aka XoAlex who unexpectedly passed away in February 2022, he was only 16 years old and was fulfilling his future goals of being a Producer, Rapper, and Song Writer. His story is to bring awareness of issues among children and teens and help other parents and/or teens to be more aware of the systematic failures that can result in death and/or long term psychological effects. No Parent should ever have to bury their child or fight for their child to be protected from a system that should be protecting our children from abusers and drugs. His story is part of <a href=\"http://KeepNMalive.com\">KeepNMalive.com</a>. My son thought he was going to eat pizza with his ex girlfriend and her mother and he came home in a body bag. Be careful what you smoke it could be your last toke. Let\u2019s change these laws and find everyone in our state who has been affected by losing a loved one to fentanyl poisoning. Also raising awareness that if a parent smokes a deadly substance with a child. There are mandatory sanctions if the victim is dead and cannot testify. Alex was due to testify against the first person who attempted to kill him through drug lacing. Unfortunately he was set up for death 2 months before he was due to testify. This real life story will have you hanging on the edge of your chair. Turning his story and my pain into purpose in changing the state of New Mexico and putting a stop to child abuse and systematic failures in place that hinder the mental health of our future. No child should have to go through failures of the family court system allowing them to be around murderers and drug traffickers. This story is the raw story of the injustices a mother has to go through to protect her child only for the child to end up dying at the failures of the system. Rest in peace to my precious babyboy Alexander. I will not give up we will change this system for future children. You lived such a painful life at the hands of humans who made it harder for you to just be a child and enjoy life.</p>",

A common saying among people, who at some point have or are on the verge of giving up, it's also a mantra of the strong.  A sense that no matter what happens, things will work out, and somehow you will get through it.  It is of course what it is.  </p><p>\u200b</p><p>Love sucks...so does everything that comes with it.  The joy, the memories and the eventual breakup.  Where the memories formed become a reminder of what you had, the plans and ideas you shared with that special someone sting more then ever; in a timeless void of \"shoulda, coulda, woulda.\" Of course, seeing a former partner, girlfriend, boyfriend etc happy is all you really want at the end of the day. Weather its with or without you.  While fostering and attempting to grow a friendship and keep the bond strong in whatever manner you can has its struggles and a daily reminder of what could have been, the bonds to friendship come with the same unique struggles.  </p><p>\u200b</p><p>This episode is my personal journey through a love found in the most unlikely of places (Grindr), to the good times and memories built, to post break-up and the daily struggle to split what was and what is.  An hour long talk of how my former relationship changed me for the good the bad and the ugly, and the gratitude that I have daily that the individual is still in my life.  Weather with me as a partner or friend.  How do you deal with breakups and how do you; over time; numb the heartache and flashbacks of the small traditions, memories and things that make you laugh? </p>",
