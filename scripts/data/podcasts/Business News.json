        "title": "10 Things You Should Know about Stakeholder Capitalism",
        "description": "In 2019, the Business Roundtable announced that the purpose of business was no longer to maximize profits for shareholders.  The new purpose of business would be to maximize value for stakeholders.  While the announcement was applauded by many, charges of hypocrisy quickly followed as the practices of many Business Roundtable member companies suddenly seemed to contradict the new more egalitarian purpose they had proclaimed.\n\nA year later, if anything is becoming clear, it is that what the world is coming to know as \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d, lacks a clear definition against which to assess the performance of a firm, or even an economy.\n \nThis lack of definition is not the result of a lack of attempts.  For years a wide variety of thought leaders and pioneering practitioners have been refining models and frameworks to define a new paradigm for business.  But none has broken into the mainstream.\n \nIn response to this situation, a team comprised of members from a variety of organizations working within the \u201cbusiness as a force for good\u201d movement attempted to create a common definition of the end-state they were all working to achieve.  Their work resulted in a brand-agnostic framework, endorsed by all, that identified six essential competencies of a business in the new paradigm.\n \nIn 10 binge-able episodes, this podcast will introduce, illustrate and popularize an ambitious and actionable definition for stakeholder capitalism.\n \nProducers/Hosts\nAmanda Kathryn Roman is a life-long convener and builder of infrastructure to scale a wide variety of movements you\u2019ve heard of, and some you have not.  Most recently she was the Chief Innovation Office for Conscious Capitalism where she joined the frenzy of activity happening all around the world to catalyze an expanded paradigm of capitalism.  In 2018, she and Nathan Havey co-founded the year-long, comprehensive certification program for consultants of Conscious Capitalism\n \nNathan Havey has been a leader of, participant-in content provider for, and strategic consultant to many of the major entities in the \u201cbusiness as a force for good movement\u201d.  A host and storyteller by training and passion, he has produced powerful live storytelling experiences in more than a dozen US cities and he wrote and directed the upcoming feature documentary Beyond Zero, and has been learning and refining a library.\n \nNathan and Amanda believe that each of the stories in this mini-series should be legend in business circles, and yet they are continually shocked to meet people, including some of the celebrity-status thought leaders and pioneering practitioners in their circles are unaware that these stories exist.  That must change.",

        "description": "Imagine your college student calls home in a panic.  Their college just announced it is about to close - for good.   \n\nHow do you avoid this story happening to you?\n\nMany private colleges have recently closed and it is likely many more will close.  \n\nOur College Viability App shows which ones are more likely to do so.   Don't let your student choose a financially unhealthy college and lose lost credits, lost time and lost money if it closes.  We have done all the work to let you compare the financial health of these colleges and choose one that will have the resources to provide your student with a solid education.\n\nAs a former college administrator, I have seen first-hand the financial challenges that too many private colleges face and have chosen not to share with you.\n\nThe College Viability App enables students, parents, leaders and others to compare the changes in a private colleges\u2019 finances, enrollment, and outcomes over a recent period of 6 years.\n\nFor families this information lets them make more informed decisions about their college choice -- limiting the risk choosing a one whose financial results suggest viability concerns in the coming months and years.\n\nFor higher education leaders, the App provides comparative data about competitors and potential merger or alliance partners.\n\nHere is a YouTube link showing how to use the College Viability App.  https://bit.ly/3jGXA9t\n\nHere is the full College Viability YouTube channel.   See if a college you are considering is reviewed for financial health and viability.    https://bit.ly/3DLq7mr\n\nIf you want to get updates to your inbox, go to   https://www.collegeviability.com/institute-lead-magnetj5cyzcmf \n\nAt CollegeViability.com, we have also developed a curated site about private colleges and higher education.  It serves as a single source for timely news about the challenges of both.\n",

The audio can be accessed through the courts and sometimes through administration websites of bankrupt companies.  But it takes a few steps to access audio and play audio accessed that way.  Thanks to amazing streaming technology including Podcasting 2.0 I am able to make the audio accessible to people around the world who may be interested in reviewing.  With additional technology I am able to provide transcripts for some of the audio recordings, in the form of unofficial computer auto generated written transcripts.  These transcripts can assist people who are hearing impaired, and other people who prefer to read along.  The unofficial transcripts can be translated into other languages for convenience, by people using Google Translate and other translation tools available on the internet.  I hope access is useful to you in some way, and thank you for listening.</p>",
