Keeping it Real will connect our audience with the real side of the athletes while bridging the gaps between the superstars and just everyday street legends. \n\nYou'll hear the behind the scenes stories of the legendary University of Michigan's Fab Five as told by Chris Webber and Jimmy King. You'll also hear inspirational stories of athletes who are transforming their communities or experiencing success in business, education, government, etc. Keeping it Real will not be afraid to ask the critical questions like Black ownership, the misuse of high school and college athletes or when the pain is making others rich but destroying the athletes bodies.
