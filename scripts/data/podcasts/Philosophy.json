We want to help you see the beauty in your struggle, and remind you that God's love for you surpasses any challenges. \n\nThis podcast won't get too theological, but it will compel you to try and see your life through God's eyes. If you're looking for a frank conversation about the practical battles and beauty found in a relationship with Jesus, please join us as we do our best to \"step out of the boat.\"",

We must adhere to our Constitution and Amendment rights the way our forefathers intended for us.\nWe encourage pro community patriotic activism when its called for and unity of all people under God as ONE Nation. We preach freedom over fear and put out the political correctness flame that is burning this nation from within while at the same time promote peace and unity through liberty by law. We are against big government bureaucrats, main stream media, anarchists, human sex trafficking, crony capitalists, socialists, American apologists and most importantly communism promoted through tyrannical leftism.\nWe The People must start talking, organizing and rallying for Patriotism, for love of this country relentlessly because we are the Relentless Patriots! Never apologize for your love of this great land!

        "description": "<p>A stolen toilet seat from the school restroom ignited the movement I created with this podcast to confront and resolve morbid conditions that students in my county are subjected to. Decaying conditions, inability to comply with federal laws regarding menstrual products, and the lack of administrative efforts to listen to student demands was what it took for my friend and I to take a stand and create a podcast which provided avenues for students to solve this issue, and resulted in administrators listening to student demands and complying with the students. We wanted to do this to give a voice to students, and we were able to go to the school district with this movement and convince them to do what students had been wanting changed for years. Something interesting about our show is that although our town and county is small, after publishing our podcast, our channel saw an 84.62% increase in subscribers to the channel because that is how passionate students were regarding this topic. What I loved the most about this whole podcast was the journey, because it took us months to do research into the inequitable laws that our district was violating, dig into old articles ranging years which provided evidence for our points, and go around to multiple schools to take interviews to showcase the range of students and their opinions regarding the bathrooms.</p>",

Let's work together to actually get you to the space where you want to be, without pretending that you're not Where You Are; doing that is the ultimate disservice to yourself. \n\nBy putting the light of your Conscious Awareness on Where You Are, it might just be enough to provide a natural shift to the place that you actually wanna be: emotionally > energetically > and then physically. \n\nWelcome to the Tribe! Happy Journeying!\n\nInstagram @MYWYATribe",

This updated timeline we're all running now is a legitimate flustercuck. Wherever one cares to look, things are getting worse. And the worst part of all?</p><p>This mess we're all snared in with its momentous culminations at this precise point in time?</p><p>Well, that's mostly on me for failing to recognize long ago that living my life with the purpose and destiny I intended when I manifested here wasn't a choice for only my amusement.</p><p>Nope. Not. Even. Close.</p><p>As it turns out, my destiny has almost nothing to do with my own life experiences and everything to do with how much help I can offer you.</p><p>And offer to you, and to you too.</p><p>And to these ladies on my left, as well as those two guys right there and to all of those kids playing up there. As well as any other homo sapien sapiens who are here needing my help.</p><p>Whether you're an eternal soul tapping into the infinite source's wisdom, or an interplanetary interloper investigating intriguing incidents involving impossible internal incisions, or an arch-angel of biblical lore (fallen or ascending, no judgement here), or a Lemurian light-being, a Pleiadean/Annunaki hybrid starseed. You might even be a silver surfer on acid teaching taekwondo in Tahiti.</p><p>Totally.</p><p>All are welcome.</p><p>Even you. Yes you. You who wrongly thinks you're nothing but a 21st century homo sapien sapien living a pointless life here on Earth v.867-5309. A life that you hope ends peacefully as you sleep.</p><p>You might have been born in Ogunquit, Maine but are now living with your Aunt Sandy in Keene, New Hampshire so you can save money while working part time at a car wash in Brattleboro, Vermont, all of which allows you to finish up your MBA at the university in Framingham, Massachusetts.</p><p>Could that be you? Manifesting now with me here? Collectively experiencing these collapsing particles riding out their wave potentials to destinations as of now, undetermined?</p><p>Because your participation and specific contribution on this timeline is what starts turning this thing around. In fact much of what's broken now will only get worse if you don't rise up to fulfill your life's unique purpose.</p><p>Yes. You.</p><p>Given the situation, I can't escape one basic thought:</p><p>\"WtF is going wrong now?\"</p><p>Usually followed by a:</p><p>\"Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse...\"</p><p>moment.</p><p>Which inevitably gives rise to thoughts like:</p><p>\"If they'll take it to this level what won't they do?!??\"</p><p>Unmoored by all the chaos, now the internal muttering starts up:</p><p>\"I just don't know any more. I mean ... who's going to fix all this? ... and how? The one thing I do know is this kind of mess won't fix itself. We're gonna need some help around here. I think we might even be running out of time to do something about it... If I'm being totally honest.\"</p><p>Yeah, yeah, call me out for my late start on the project. I deserve it.</p><p>I admit that I should have gotten this going way before January 2, 2022. However, starting things at the last possible second is kind of my thing.</p><p>That said, when I do show up, I come prepared to work with concentrated purpose until the job's 100% completed.</p><p>Come join me if you are so inclined, but do so with at least a 1.5x uptick in playback speed. You'll thank me later for all the time saved.</p><p>I add to my nonsense daily, or at least I try to. If I'm absent for a day or two it's nothing to be concerned about. I likely broke another phone or fell victim to some other equally unglamorous event. I'll return sooner or later... probably later.</p><p>Much like yourself I still have some of life's crossroads left to navigate. Many lessons to learn. Many people to meet. In doing so, I promise not to forego any life rewards I've yet to experience!</p><p>And neither should you!</p>",

Loss, in this context, is viewed as an inevitable part of life and a prism through which we explore artistic practice and expression. \n \nSophia is interested in building a space where creatives can openly discuss their observations, their stories and the resulting strategies in order to alleviate isolation, make broader connections and create a supportive community. \n\n\nWebsite here https://www.sophandson.com/\nPatreon: https://www.sophandson.com/whereartandgriefmeet \nPaypal: https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/8L9Ak8pJu3\n\n",

Your mind impressions determine the conditions of your world. The mind is not selective; it is impersonal and no respecter of persons. The mind is not concerned with the truth or falsity of your feeling. It always accepts as true that which you feel to be true. Feeling is the assent of the mind to the truth of that which is declared to be true. Because of this quality of the subconscious there is nothing impossible to man. Whatever the mind of man can conceive and feel as true, the mind can and must objectify. Your feelings create the pattern from which your world is fashioned, and a change of feeling is a change of pattern.\u201d",

How do we work with others with whom we differ ideologically on every other issue except the issue of abortion to promote a culture of life? These are just some of the questions we wrestle with on our Dear Jane podcast. The other side only wants to highlight our differences, but we want to talk with people in the movement about what unites us. Dear Jane focuses on the one thing we can all agree on: the sanctity of every human life. Dear Jane will host the hard conversations, ask the tough questions, and acknowledge our differences while always keeping in mind our shared beliefs.

As I dealt with my own experience of grief and pain, I became fascinated with life and death. I have since explored what it's been like to go through addiction, death, and divorce.</p><p>I have come to a place of acceptance and peace around not only my brother's death, but many of life's anxieties.</p><p>My curiosity now takes me on a journey to understand what it has been like for those around me to experience life and death.</p><p>In my podcast, I talk to friends and family about their lives and what it was like to lose our dear friend and brother, Dan. I explore many topics, including death and suicide.</p><p>I encourage you to listen with an open heart, but be prepared that the subject matter can be difficult at times. Go gently</p>",

        "description": "<p>Religious Artifacts focuses on a healthy and loving conversation on various topics in different religious and social aspects in life. When it was originally thought of in 2018 by Juan Hartman, he had a purpose in mind to start spreading more positive love through healthy conversations after living such a violent and dissatisfying life. One of his biggest influences in this idea was his best friend and brother, CJ Kelly, who during a hard time in Juan\u2019s life, was always there out of love and was always willing to speak and talk. Even though their religious ideas were not the same, they always were able to have a great conversation with a hug in the end. With this Juan realized that there is a potential to share a bond and brotherhood regardless the God(s) you follow or the religious life you live, as long as your moralities lined up and you were willing to converse and not argue in the end. With this idea, Religious Artifacts was born, a place where the idea of \u201cReligion\u201d is the \u201cArtifact\u201d, a place where relationships on human morality and love can be formed because we can all agree in the end that\u2019s what wins. We hope to have fun discussions on the histories on all and any religious idea and bring each other together in conversation. Our goal in the end will always to be to give back with positivity and love. Look for us in the future to be starting our own Non-Profits to give back to those in the world that need it and spread that love.</p>",
