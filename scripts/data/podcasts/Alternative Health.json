        "description": "<p>Join me for an authentic raw vegan journey. I will never sugar coat my experience, lol. If you're searching for a pristine, flawless, skyrocket to raw perfection, keep searching. This is not it. My raw journey resembles a big pile of knotted zoodles. I bought my first raw book, Juliano's RAW in 2000. In 2006, I finally realized that raw a was an actual lifestyle, not just a handful of freakishly disciplined people, and I started 'going raw.' I've gone raw and fallen down literally hundreds of times. But I'm always learning and honing my skills. I will not stop. I can't. There's nothing like raw. I believe it's the absolute best version of myself, hands down, the person I was meant to be. How can you discover your full potential, if you're not using the best fuel and becoming your best self? Raw veganism is an incredibly healing path. It's also the way I choose to manage my ADHD and the most effective way I've discovered since being diagnosed at age 6. In 2005 at hypnotherapy school, I experienced a powerful dream, did dream a therapy session on myself and developed an obsession with self healing. Off the top of my head, I've healed uterine fibroids, squamous skin cancers, UTIs, sinus infections, plantar fasciitis, bronchitis and most recently an undetermined autoimmune illness. Join me for an honest look at a raw path and growth.</p>",

This includes marrying mysticism, science, religions, ancient medicines, sexuality, tribal rituals, psychology, health and fitness and much more.\n\nIt's time to enhance and expand our collective consciousness by breaking free from mind influencing conditionings of who we once believed to be and to begin finding the commonalities in one another to empower each of us of who we are truly meant to be...

Content is intuitively guided and so what comes up is what I will be talking about!\nOften, if not always, content reflects what is going on in my own personal healing journey, or what I see coming up for those around me, or both.\nHere's a bit about me and my background:\nI was born in America and lived there for just over two decades before I moved to Israel with my family over 20 years ago. \nI am a Holistic Healer with over ten years of experience practicing CranioBalance Therapy, have a thriving range of Flower Essences (Beit Roga Gardens*) made from flowers, trees, and elements in my home community in Israel, as well as from the Dead Sea, and run a private practice called Beit Roga* (House of Tranquility). I have learned many other holistic healing techniques along the way, and all my healing is done on an intuitive level. (*Check out more at beitroga.com and beitroga.com/shop)\nI started out as a Physical Therapist and quickly learned that I was healing via intuitive feedback. I also recognized that simply dealing with the physical aspect of a client's pain or dysfunction was not dealing with the whole picture. \nOver the years I have trusted my inner knowing and followed my intuitive guidance to learning more and more about holistic healing, and most importantly, to trusting the information that comes to me intuitively. It all links back together and each time I learn another aspect of healing I am amazed anew at all the inter-connections. It all comes from one Source, and that is made clear over and over again. \nWe are living in exciting, magical times when more and more healing is coming up to the surface. Old healing practices coming back to modern day use, intuitive guidance on the rise in peoples' awareness, holistic healing becoming more and more popular with the general population, and a greater forum expanding globally for all this information to come to light.\nIf you have found me, then there is magic here for you to explore. I look forward to reading your comments about how this information resonates for you. \nDevorah Harow\nAlchemist and Intuitive Healer\nIsrael\nHealing from the Holy Land\n",

Each week, Sarah unpacks a topic that affects our everyday health with the latest facts & research from well-respected experts in their field (academia, science, medicine, health).\n\nIt can be hard to sift through all the information we are bombarded with when it comes to health - especially when we don't know who to trust. We bring you experienced voices to cut through that noise of misinformation and give you the foundational knowledge you need to make up your own mind. Our goal is to breakdown complicated subjects into the philosophy of 'gentle changes': small steps we can take to create healthy and sustainable habits in the long-term!\n\nA former Assoc. Professor at the School of Health & Human Performance at Dublin City University, Sarah brings her passion & expertise to each conversation -  creating casual and easy-to-follow conversations with experts covering Gut Health; Pelvic Health; Menopause; Skincare; Chronic Disease; Heart Health and much more.\n\nNo More 'Taboo' Subjects!\nThe Natural Health Revolution wants to empower people to understand how to take care of their own bodies without embarrassment. Sarah and her guests lead by example with honest conversations about subjects we need to get comfortable with if we want to take care of ourselves and each other.",

        "description": "Hosts Sarrah and Jasmine create a conversational journey as they take on unchartered territories of what is to become a 'New Human' through all topics Mind-Body-Spirit. \n\nThe hosts' life-long, personal, metaphysical and extra-sensory events alongside decades of spiritual practice provide  a  springboard for all-encompassing and unlikely discussions based around the purpose and machinations of existence, through the merging of Science and Spirit as we transform into our personal and collective human evolution through Ascension. \n\nSarrah and Jasmine take turns each week opening the discussion for anything and everything related to becoming a New Human.\n\nBeyond Darwin\u2019s evolve or die hypothesis of survival of the fittest, humanity has done a fantastic job of survival, but with little regard to the expense of the planet, our health, each other, and our soul\u2019s intended journey of spiritual awakening into love and unity consciousness. \n\nThe next evolution of human development can not mimic the past, nor do most of us want it to. As the rest of the world weighs out the long-planned Great Reset, the New Human challenges that the greatest transformation of humanity will take place on the inside first. We explore the paradigms of spiritual practice, dogma, societal mass consciousness and its ongoing programming, and propose new ways to discover our own deepest truths. We learn how to discover a deeper resonance beyond our five senses.\n\nFrom Med-Beds to Frequency Medicine, Extra-Terrestrial civilizations to using the human body as a frequency antennae, spirituality, oneness, ancient wisdom leading to full-energetic awakening, the sky\u2019s the limit as we conceptualize together, the latest discoveries and ideas that will transform the progress of the human race in the way it was always intended - a more natural and connected soul-driven evolution. \n\nWe\u2019ve all heard about the New Earth. Let\u2019s take the journey together to uncover this new human that will thrive as it brings forth its Golden Age, ensuring that the next human evolution is for the betterment of all.\n\n~ Hosts, Jasmine Sterling and Sarrah Powell\n~ Original Music by permission of artist Ray McGeehan   https://amzn.to/3M3MPKg\n\nwww.sarrahpowell.com\nwww.bighappyplanet.com",

        "description": "Hi! My name\u2019s Harry, and welcome to Passing Through A Vegan Door Podcast. \n\nVeganism is a growing idea that leaving animals alone can save the world. It can be quite scary to take those first steps and change life long habits, but it\u2019s important to find a way to break those habits and understand that what we do to animals every day isn\u2019t right. \n\nPassing Through A Vegan Door is a way for me to talk about the things I care about while offering an insight into the who's, the what's, the when's, the where's, the why's, and the how's of being vegan. This podcast is for everyone: whether you\u2019ve got decades more experience than me in being vegan; or you just wish vegans would shut up and let you eat your steak in peace. I\u2019m not the expert\u2026 I\u2019m just here to pass on the word. Hopefully it can be somewhat entertaining as I do. \n\nI will cover a range of topics such as: the environment, society, health, politics, diet, the animals themselves, and more! I will be chatting to people who share a similar mindset, and a common goal of living a vegan lifestyle, but also people who couldn\u2019t care less. Those are the people who have the power to make real change. Small changes do make a big difference, and I hope to show you how.\n\n\u201cTo be vegan, is to release your grip on the animal\u201d\n\nThank you for reading, I hope whatever I can offer can be of help.

What about the constant headaches and mood swings that you deal with every day?</p><p>Well, girl, I am so excited you\u2019re here!</p><p>In this podcast, you will learn how to regulate your period naturally, decrease mood swings (yes, even postpartum!), eliminate headaches, and enjoy sex again!</p><p>I\u2019m Dominique, a mom, military wife, daughter of Jesus, and women\u2019s hormone specialist! I remember a time when I suffered with the worst period cramps and migraines. Then, after my first daughter, I suffered from postpartum depression. However, I did not want the new form of birth control that everyone told me to try. I wanted to get to the root cause of my problems and not just slap a \u201cband-aid\u201d on them. So I went back to school (yes with a new baby and a toddler) for my Master of Science in Nutrition Sciences with my focus in women\u2019s hormones.</p><p>I learned how to heal my hormones and created a plan that was easy, natural, and doable because that\u2019s what I needed as a busy mom of littles. And now I\u2019m ready to share everything I\u2019ve learned with you.</p><p>If you are ready to finally get to the root cause of your period problems, mood swings, and lack of sex drive, then grab your notebook and pen (or crayon if that\u2019s all you can find), your beverage of choice, and get ready to listen in!</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://Hormonehealing.org\">Hormonehealing.org</a></p><p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:hormonehealing1@gmail.com\">hormonehealing1@gmail.com</a> </p>",

I also host guests to talk about their own personal lived experiences with neurodiversity, as every neurodistinct person is different and experiences neurodiversity in their own unique ways. My goal is to provide relatable content for other neurodistinct folks and also to educate neurotypicals about Autism, ADHD and other neurotypes, while also trying to show how neurodistinct people can thrive if provided the right environment and properly accommodated, rather than treated as broken puzzle pieces that need to be fixed. *I am not a professional and do not represent the viewpoint of all neurodistinct people, I am just one neurodistinct person speaking about Autism and ADHD from my personal lived experiences, as well as the personal lived experiences of my guests.</p><p>*Check out the portuguese version of this podcast, \"Explicando Neurodiversidade\", and my second podcast \"Talking Weather\" (both are available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts)</p><p>Feel free to contact me at ginhobeleza@gmail.com with any comments or inquiries related to this podcast :)</p>",

Meditation can open doorways to immense joy and pleasure. You can learn how to shift into a higher happiness and dwell in it.</p><p>Ranga began his training with formal meditation practice at age 10, and has been on a journey of discovery ever since. After years of climbing the corporate ladder and later co-founding startups, he has shifted his career towards sharing his enthusiastic approach to meditation practice. Ranga's teaching style entails bringing the ancient wisdom of the Buddha to the modern ear, through personal stories and contemporary similes. </p><p>Rather than offering a singular, rigid view, he believes that we each hold the authority to find our authentic path in life and to deeply free ourselves up from worrying, anger, doubt, dullness and a sense of lacking. As such, he approaches his role as a teacher with an open heart; open to all the particularities, experiences and uniqueness of each student. He draws on over 20 years of meditation practice and a lifetime of learning from Buddhist (and a few Daoist) meditation masters to guide students on their personal journeys towards what they yearn for.</p>",

Undesirable noise, like air and vehicle traffic that doesn\u2019t disturb sleep can still affect sleep by changing the time we spend in different sleep stages, increasing lighter sleep stages and decreasing more restorative slow wave and REM sleep. Noises during sleep may increase secretion of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol and elevate heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>Short-term, fatigue, irritability, and poorer mental health are associated with exposure to nighttime noise. Long-term, poor quality sleep due to noise can have a number of adverse effects \u2013 heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, weight gain, increased use of sleep medications , decreased overall health, and certain types of cancer.</p><p>A very popular solution is to mask unwanted noise with a more desirable acoustic environment. Many find that masking background noise helps to distract from anxious or intrusive thoughts and readies the mind for sleep. The sounds found to be universally most effective are:</p><p>* Classic White Noise</p><p>* Ocean Waves &amp; Beach Sounds</p><p>* Raindrops &amp; Flowing Water</p><p>* Woods &amp; Wilderness</p><p>* Relaxing Music</p><p>* Pink Noise</p><p>* Soothing Voices</p>",

Cultivating a sense of belonging is crucial, as it provides a safe space for navigating our inevitable growth, allowing us to return to our place in the world with a deep sense of purpose - a birthright we all deserve.</p><p>Mothermouth is dedicated to embarking on diverse and transformative journeys towards body connection, power, and pleasure. Our podcast series begins by delving into the realms of birth and its physiology - the profound act of bringing a child into the world. Giving birth signifies the embodiment of our existence, and becoming a mother marks a significant shift in our lives, both from a bodily and societal perspective. While the physical changes are noticeable and acknowledged, we also explore the subtle yet deeply transformative psychological changes of becoming a mother and the challenges we face.</p><p>But this is just the beginning. As we set sail from this starting point, our journey will traverse a multitude of subjects, guided by guest speakers and the ever-changing winds of our listeners. As the helmswoman of this ship, I am simultaneously navigating my own voyage towards the imminent rite of passage that is menopause, while still grieving the recent loss of my own mother.</p><p>I am passionate about all of us reclaiming sovereignty and standing in our power if that is in our health, purpose, or body connection. And experiencing the joy of sharing and witnessing this in community.</p><p>If you are enjoying the series, please support me in making these podcasts and hosting the website through buying me a coffee: <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mothermouth\">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/mothermouth</a>,</p><p>And visit my website: <a href=\"https://mothermouth.co.uk\">https://mothermouth.co.uk</a></p><p>Thank you so much for being here and on this journey together!</p><p>Music by 12Volt, with great thanks to my friend Sascha Usison.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Join Canadian Podcast Host and HG Content Creator, <strong>Tori Moline (@goldenteachertori)</strong>, as she takes a deep dive into an untalked about maternal health crisis <strong>Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG)</strong>. HG is a genetic pregnancy illness characterized by cyclical vomiting, malnutrition, weight loss and dehydration. It's an uphill battle and can often take years to heal from. Many medical professionals do not know about HG. Many mom's are treated poorly in doctor/hospital care while barely surviving and growing a baby. The current solutions being offered to HG mom's are not working and having short/long term consequences. Some brave women have found a glimmer of hope in a highly<strong> stigmatized </strong>(sometimes <strong>illegal!</strong>)<strong> anti-nauseant</strong> <strong>plant</strong> during this time; <strong>cannabis.</strong></p><p>For centuries, HG pregnancies have often gone undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and/or in some cases, congratulated because of maternal weight loss. History tells us that pregnant women have been silenced for a very long time. History tells us that pregnant women have not been given the space, community, or resources that allow them to thrive. History tells us that HG mom's have been the biggest victim's of this.</p><p>HG mom's have not received proper care for generations. HG mom's who have faced HG pregnancies have <strong>rarely</strong> been given education, resources, or appropriate care. </p><p>Cannabis laws vary state to state and country to country. The barrier to many HG mom's is access. It is inhumane that HG mom's are drug tested at birth and persecuted according to their state laws/hospital policies for trying to survive HG.</p><p>16 raw stories capturing HG and it's multi-layered wrath... 16 women's stories illustrating a maternal health crisis... 16 HG mom's who bravely chose cannabis.</p>",
