        "description": "\"Ish Can Dish\" covers a wide range of basketball topics by exploring backstories of teams and players, NBA rookies, Eastern and Western Conference powerhouses as well as exploring how different aspects of society can be impacted by the game. Ever since I was in elementary school, I always had a fascination with sports, especially basketball. I always admired the pace of the game, the athletes and how the analytics of the game have revolutionized how teams approach the game on the offensive and defensive side of the ball. Sports have always been a big part of my life and talking about sports with people has helped me create stronger relationships with my family and friends. My goal of this show is to educate the average fan about the teams and players they love, while also helping them develop new perspectives about sports in general. If you love debating about sports with your family and friends, this is the podcast for you! I hope you guys enjoy this experience with me.  \n",
