Environmental devastation?  Labor precarity?  Alienation?  We pick a different societal plague each week and talk with an expert about how that plague makes the coronavirus deadlier. \n</p> \n\n     We then move on to discuss \u201ctreatments\u201d or even \u201ccures\u201d for that plague: what kinds of political or cultural action we can take to \u201ccure\u201d it.  Since many of our guest experts are also artists, they are invited to share a creative work on the topic\u2014a song, poem, monologue\u2014of their own creation or choosing.\n</p>\n\n     Guests include poet and Friends of the Earth organizer Jeff Conant, Dr. Rupa Marya of the Do No Harm Coalition and the band Rupa and the April Fishes, performance artists Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, theatre activist Aryeh Shell, affordable medicine activist Merith Basey, playwright and San Francisco Mime Troupe member Michael Gene Sullivan, and many more.\n</p>\n\n     Your host, L.M.

We zijn verbonden met elkaar door kunst, maar ook door eten en gezelligheid.\n\nWe verbinden op een laagdrempelige manier de onderwerpen en theorie\u00ebn die ons inspireren met het alledaagse en herkenbare. We werken vanuit de overtuiging dat kunst ons kan helpen om na te denken over nieuwe manieren om de wereld te bekijken en in te richten. Graag gaan we zelfs nog een stap verder dan hierover nadenken, en proberen we de idee\u00ebn die we bespreken ook dagelijks in de praktijk te brengen. We verzetten ons tegen de patriarchale norm die in onze maatschappij nog steeds leidend is, en stellen in plaats daarvan collectiviteit, waardering, zorg, overleg en emotie centraal.

Daar waar voorheen de vleugels werden gespreid om iets te ondernemen, ploffen zij nu neer met een biertje op de bank. Zoals Cruijff zei: \u201cElk nadeel heb zijn voordeel\u201d. Het afgelopen jaar was er meer ruimte voor diepgang en zingeving. Er werden steeds langere en diepgaande gesprekken gevoerd. Veelal liepen deze gesprekken uit tot een discussie, waarbij de heren elkaar niet sparen. Je zou rustig kunnen zeggen dat de \u00e9\u00e9n na de ander het pispaaltje is. Allemaal met een korreltje zout en de rode draad is gebaseerd op een liefdevolle broederschap waarin satire en humor hoog in het vaandel staan.\n \nDeze mannen zijn werkzaam in een andere tak van sport. Paul is audio engineer, Omid een consultant en Jo\u00ebl werkt in de GGZ. Totaal uiteenlopende beroepen. Wat hun samenbrengt is muziek. Uit verveling hebben zij een track opgenomen. Want; Hoe moeilijk kan het zijn op een knap liedje te produceren? En hoe moeilijk kan het zijn op een podcast op te nemen? Je zou kunnen zeggen dat zij geen uitdaging uit de weg gaan. Of het een succes is? Of je hier blij van wordt? Oordeel zelf\u2026.\n \nDe podcast\nElke aflevering worden er een aantal (mannelijke) onderwerpen besproken die centraal staan in het leven van deze heren. In gesprek proberen ze steun en antwoorden bij elkaar te vinden. De heren tappen alle drie uit  een ander vaatje, wat de belichting qua invalshoek gekleurd houdt.\n \nEnjoy",

When members of the Glenn Korff School of Music reached out to me about creating videos to help keep our community connected, I thought this would be a perfect idea. Going beyond the Flyover New Music Series, in Chatting With Creators, I connect with various creatives from the music industry to talk to them about how they\u2019re dealing with the pandemic, their advice for students, and most importantly, how we all stay connected even when we\u2019re apart. \n\nI thought this would be a one-and-done series, but I've had so many requests to continue!

        "description": "Introducing Stage Dives, the first podcast from the media nerds who run SMACK out of Toronto Canada and hosted by Aaron Chan. We\u2019re going to be talking about everything we\u2019ve been listening to and watching, but first and foremost we\u2019re going to be talking about concerts.\nTo make the most of the stampede of live music we\u2019re about to witness from arena tours to 19+ shows to basement gigs, we\u2019re going to giving you our best on the road today. We\u2019ll be breaking down setlists, talking about fanbases, and having a larger conversation about the artist or work in question.\nWe\u2019ve also got episodes about movies, TV shows, sports, and of course music, plus everything else our team of pop culture-obsessives want to deliver to you. So like and subscribe if you\u2019re a concert addict and want to be part of a conversation on all of the concerts hitting Toronto.",

I also happen to be a girl, and despite it being 2022, only 3% of trumpet players are female. Consequently, I have always had to navigate a male-dominated environment riddled with gender, age, and power dynamics\u2026 in other words I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of crap and I\u2019m sick of it!\n\nThe title of this podcast, The Brass Ceiling, is really just a play on the phrase \"the glass ceiling\"; this pun on the famous saying feels relevant as I want to bring to light the gendered struggle that female brass players experience which is preventing them from thriving in this niche, just as on a more macro level, women and most non-straight-cis-white-men have to navigate countless systems that were not built with them in mind.\n\nI want to use this space to talk about our stories and our musical journeys, but I also want to use this platform to crowdsource and workshop ideas to make the arts more equitable. The goal is to find that sweet spot that is fun and nostalgic, but also rigorous and forward-facing. I\u2019m hoping that by sharing our experiences, by engaging in dialogue about the systems that need changing, and by delving into music in a way that is accessible as well as palatable,  that we will in fact be shattering the Brass Ceiling, together.",

        "description": "Women in Action was an arts and heritage project, led by Collective Encounters in 2020-2022, that used drama and creativity to celebrate women\u2019s resilience, activism and community organising across Merseyside. The Ballad of 18 Women is the major final outcome of the project, incorporating testimonies recorded in oral history interviews as well as poetic narration and original music and song. \n\nThis radio ballad highlights the stories of 18 Merseyside women to give an insight into the incredible contributions women make every day to improve lives in our region. Woven together, they give a glimpse of the multitude of positive actions that hold, nurture and empower our communities.\n\nThe 18 women share a concern for fairness and social justice, but their causes, actions and impacts are many and varied. Some would not consider themselves to be \u2018activists\u2019, but all have given of themselves to help others and in doing that have made the world a better place. The radio ballad pulls some common threads from their stories; the archive collection (available online or on request) offers the full recording for each person, showing the richness of their individual contributions.\n\nWe hope the ballad and recordings will inspire new women activists, as well as sustain, celebrate and encourage those who are already working for change: it is a homage to these 18 women and to you.\n\nWritten by Sarah Thornton\nComposed by Bethany Kay Hopkins\nDirected by Tessa Buddle\nSound Design by Karen Lauke\nArtwork by Doriscakes Creates\n\nFeaturing the voices of: \nAlma Brown, Anna Reid, Anne Gorton, Anya Chapman, Chantelle Lunt, Clara Paillard, Doreen McNally, Felicity Dowling, Imogen Woolley, Johanna Schweier, June Hudson, Keith Barber, Libby Mackay, Lois Woolley, Lynda Cash, Maddy Vaz, Margaret Mariette, Mary O\u2019Sullivan, Olivia Graham, Terri Heldt, Tracey Dunn, Zi Lan Liao\n\nFor more information about Women in Action visit: https://collective-encounters.org.uk/projects/women-in-action/\n\nTo explore the full interviews with the 18 women visit: https://audio.maydayrooms.org/the-ballad-of-18-women \n\nMade possible with funding from National Lottery Heritage Fund, PH Holt Foundation, LCVS, Arts Council England, and Liverpool City Council; archived in partnership with the Museum of Liverpool and MayDay Radio.",

If they fail to launch his giggle code, (01101000 01100001) he promises to initiate the robot wars and destroy all humans. Can comedy save the world? Find out in the next episode!\n\nWhile listening Skit Your Shorts, you may laugh, you may cry, or you may drive your car into a burning building. If the latter, ask yourself, \"am I a moth? Why else would I drive straight into this shining ball of fire? Who gave a moth a driver's license?\"\n\nWhile you're busy contemplating your mortality, someone else should be calling the fire department. I bet the firefighters look just like in those calendars full of beefy hunks welcoming you into each month. Just kidding, they're probably all out of shape. Why else would the building still be on fire long enough for you to drive into it? Beefcakes would have been there in seconds. Firetruck?

        "description": "It's easier to say what the show ISN'T! This show ISN'T your typical, consultant-driven oldies show that only plays the same 300 songs over and over until you are sick of hearing them. It ISN'T robot-radio with a personality-less host and lots of liner cards. It ISN'T a show that tells listeners they can't request a song they want to hear instead of the consultants choice.\n\nWhat it IS is a unique, weekly oldies radio program that caters to its base of dedicated fans and regular listeners. It's different every week with the ability to draw from a playlist of over 17,000 titles! Its host, Mark Edwards, brings life, personality and interaction to the show. It's fans are loyal followers with many listening from the opening intro to the close.\n\nThe mission statement could be summed up as: \"At least once each broadcast, you'll roll your eyes back, place your hand on your forehead and say wow, I haven't heard this song in years!'\nIt began with uncertainty in 1994 but eventually turned into a ratings success story.  Mark Edwards brought his creativity, charm and music collection to the airwaves of Connecticut to bring listeners on a trip back in time.  So successful that it achieved the highest ratings of any show on the station\u2019s lineup during its last Arbitron entry.  His unmistakable ability to give the audience what they wanted paved the way for success for over 28 years! The key to that success was, and still is, the diverse playlist. Thousands of songs from not only the \u201cHit Makers\u201d of the time, but lesser known, but equally important groups.  Groups like The Academics, Accents, Admirations, Lee Andrews & The Hearts, Angels, Barons, Bell Notes, Blenders, Blossoms, Blue Notes, Bop Chords, Boss Tones, Cadets, Cadillacs, Calvanes, Cameos, Capris, Cardinals, Carnations, Cavaliers, Cellos, Earl Lewis & The Channels, Chaperones, Charms, Chimes, Chords, Cleftones, Clovers, Crests, Crows, Danleers, Darts, Defenders, Del Vikings, Dells, Demensions, Desires, Dominos, Dootones, Dreamlovers, Dubs, Duprees, Earls, Edsels, Emeralds, Eternals, Falcons, Fantastics, Fascinators, Five Keys, Five Royales, Five Satins, Flamingos, G-Clefs, Genies, Harptones, Heartbeats, Impalas, Inspirators, Jacks, Jaguars, Jewels, Jesters, Jive Bombers, Keytones, Bob Knight Four, Kodaks, Legends, Little Joe & The Thrillers, Love Notes, Frankie Lymon & The Teenagers, Lewis Lymon & The Teenchords, Magnificents, Marcels, Medallions, Mellows, Midnighters, Monarchs, Moonglows, J Neons, Nino & The Ebb Tides, Nobles, Nutmegs, Orchids, Orioles, Paragons, Paradons, Pearls, Penguins, Pentagons, Platters, Pyramids, Queens, Quin Tones, Ravens, Rays, Revlons, Rivieras, Rob Roys, Royal Jesters, Royal Teens, Scarlets, Schoolboys, Sensations, Shells, Shep & The Limelites, Sheppards, Solitaires, Spaniels, Starlites, Titans, Tokens, Top Notes, Treniers, Turbans, Universals, Uniques, Untouchables, Valentines, Valiants, Van Dykes, Velours, Videls, Videos, Vito & The Salutations, Wanderers, Wheels, Willows, LITERALLY TO NAME JUST A CHOSEN FEW!!!\n\nALL THAT IN ADDITION TO CHART TOPPERS LIKE ...

From legends like Ann Margret, Ralph Bellamy, and Charlton Heston, to modern stars like Virginia Madsen, Adam Baldwin, and Rainn Wilson, the list of actors, writers, directors, producers, animators, set designers, costume designers, and more, is long. But why? What is it that makes New Trier so different? In this podcast, we will explore the answers to those questions by directly interviewing the graduates themselves. These are their stories.",

Every conversation reveals the simple ways each artist used to grow followers organically without monetary backing from a record label.</p><p>During the last 2 and a half decades, Fx2 has seen what was previously considered \"indie,\" slowly morph into semi-mainstream practices of marketing, promotion and media/press. He also has witnessed the reverse, noting that grass rooted campaigns once considered taboo for signed musicians to lose the attached stigma as more superstar talent utilized methods of what can only be called \"Organic-Ish.\"</p><p>The podcast gives you an opportunity to hear how different musicians navigate their specific path as an independent artist. As social media platforms compete for ways to dominate one another, musicians are seeing the immense benefits of cooperation and collaboration instead.</p>",

        "description": "<p><em>...where tradition meets innovation, and together, we bring PIANO into the 21st Century.</em></p><p>Hey, \ud83c\udfb9 enthusiasts out there! My name is Yukimi, a classical pianist and educator from NYC and executive producer of The Piano Pod. The Piano Pod\ud83c\udf99 is a one-of-a-kind podcast that delves deep into the fascinating world of classical music, with a specific focus on the \ud83c\udfb9 piano. In a biweekly format, the show explores intriguing discussions with guests breaking exciting new ground in the classical music industry.<a href=\"https://thepianopod.com\"> The Piano Pod</a> aims to nurture a thriving community that embraces innovative approaches to ensure classical music's relevance and vitality in today's dynamic landscape.</p><p><strong><em>\"How can I present the beautiful tradition of classical music to the 21st-century audience in a fun, contemporary, and engaging way?\"</em></strong></p><p>When I started building<a href=\"https://yukimisongstudio.com\"> a piano studio</a> in the trendy neighborhood of Downtown Manhattan in 2007 while in the NYU graduate program in piano studies, I began to ponder this question. I realized the stark difference in expectations toward classical music and music education between music professionals and the general public. Then, one of the NYU music department's professors suggested I start a podcast: the platform would allow classical musicians to address this disparity and spark conversations about audience engagement.</p><p>Finally, fast forward to 10+ years later, The Piano Pod was born in the summer of 2020. Since then, I have had the privilege of interviewing A-listers in the classical music industry: international concert pianists, composers, arrangers, digital streamers/influencers, music educators, entrepreneurs, neurodiverse specialists, and performance psychologists.</p><p>Through fascinating conversations, we have explored how classical music should continue to evolve to remain relevant to our lifestyle, society, and culture. Over the past three seasons, The Piano Pod has achieved remarkable success by reaching faithful listeners on <a href=\"https://rss.com/podcasts/the-piano-pod/\">audio platforms</a> and viewers via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ThePianoPod\">YouTube</a>.</p><p>As the show is celebrating the past season's achievements and gearing toward the new season in the fall, my mission as the Executive Producer is crystal clear:<strong> to provide a platform for classical musicians and educators to reflect and discuss ways to keep our industry robust and meaningful in this ever-changing world and move it forward in the post-pandemic era. </strong></p><p>\ud83d\udd17Follow TPP on <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/thepianopodnyc\">social media accounts</a> to get the latest news about \ud83c\udfb9. </p><p>Thanks for listening\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb9</p>",

Like many creatives, I was navigating the virtual and audio space during the pandemic. I had been in-talks with my Talent Managers at Bohemia Group to develop a full Audio Drama Series and have Philly Chick Pictures and I produce a project, while still quarantining, to keep me creatively inspired. I greatly appreciated Curt\u2019s writing talents and was impressed with his expertise in Sound Effects. Curt had pitched me a few fantastic storyline ideas, I fell in love with A Voice In Violet, and we began our production development process in the fall of 2021. We spent ample time fleshing out this series and assembling the necessary components. I was blessed to have Casting Director, Alison Buck, sign-on to help me cast our talented Actors (I had dreamed of!) Bronson Pinchot, Nikki Blonsky, and Nelson Lee (Thank you, Kat Seigworth!), then I had to have my talented friends and associates, Eric Etebari and Wilson Jermaine Heredia, onboard, as their roles were written for them, along with songs from my darling Diva Songstress Fawn, and score from the wild musical mind of Composer Michael Trapp. We truly assembled a dream cast, as well as keeping our commitment to diverse and inclusive character development and casting. As an Actress, I loved playing Violet so very much. Curt wrote this role perfectly for me and I had so much fulfillment finding the layers of this character throughout the audio series. I only hope the narrative audio podcast fans and listeners are entertained by A Voice In Violet.\" </em>- Brooke Lewis Bellas</p><p><em>\"It has been a thrill creating in the audio space, and with our talented cast who truly elevated the words off the page.

The primary execution is through the creative industry (in dance, in film and literary devices).</p><p>We aim to challenge the norms in practice within the creative industry by approaching the creative industry as not merely those accredited as creatives but by integrating the community activities directly with activities and the creative process within the industry.</p>",

As explained in the introduction episode of the first podcast series by the same name and author, there are five parts of the epic poem. The first part of the epic poem presents the ancient testimony of Enoch who describes his extraterrestrial abduction experience and the reason for it to have occurred two generations before the birth of Noah. Enoch was the seventh man from Adam, and he was Almighty God's first prophet.</p><p>Season Two of this podcast series will cover the parables of Enoch, which are Enoch's presentation of additional, prophetic messages to future generations that might endeavor to read and understand his book. Because the original <em>Book of Enoch</em> may have actually been memorized in poetic format and spoken aloud from one generation to the next, this poetic retelling is being presented in oral fashion by reading it aloud.</p><p>Listeners can listen to the second season of this series for free with advertising on all the usual platforms, but early release and advertising free listening are available on Apple Podcasts.  The entire production will be available as an audiobook or PDF with an estimated release date in December 2023.</p><p>Please visit our Associated Author's website!</p>",

If you're a dancer currently working and learning in a dance company, you could align yourself with the company's vision, whether that's teaching, doing events, government shows, or anything else really. Here are three main types: teachers, small-scale choreographers, and senior choreographers. No matter your age, these professionals can help you take your dance skills to the next level. How many types of choreographers are there? First off, we have teachers. These are the ones skilled in making a non-dancer dance. It doesn't matter if they're kids, teenagers, or adults. The second type of choreographers is the cross between small-scale choreographers and assistant choreographers. They may lack experience, but they make up for it with their creativity and childlike sense of wonder. They are fueled by their curiosity, always willing to learn and do more. The third type is the army of experienced choreographers, including the senior choreographers or lead choreographers. These are the ones whose names are known far and wide, recognized for their unique concepts. Then, we've got the directors of choreography, the folks behind the camera. They work in ad shoots, movies, music videos, and massive musicals. Finally, we have system creators, who create a dance education system or program that countless people sign up to learn from. The video is for all the people who are from the Dance, Music or Entertainment background to help them gain knowledge of their respective professions while focusing on the - choosing options if you're a dancer in your Teens, 20's or 30's - visualising the demands of ever evolving entertainment industry and creating solutions to serve those demands - having a winner's mindset by being surrounded by the winners - formal training for a dancer - all about musicality - earning money as a dancer in india - becoming an entrepreneur in entertainment industry - how a dancer should manage money for future - how to sell your services and negotiate with clients willing to take your services - how to deal with copy cats who copy your ideas in much lesser price and compromise the market prices - how to establish a brand and stand out - the most important things a dancer, performer and artist should experience in life * Don't oblige anyone, the entertainment industry is mean and so should you be</p>",

Noah, Enoch's great grandson, was the second human to have been abducted by extraterrestrials. Referring to the Chosen One (Jesus Christ) as \"son of woman\" is a blasphemy of Almighty God, which condemns the theology of Catholicism because it claims Jesus Christ was the son of God (son of woman), and many other shocking truths about the <em>Eternal Truth </em>that have been concealed from mankind for the last 2,000 years.</p><p>This final season still has plenty <em>Antediluvian Revelations</em> to present, so get ready for the apocalypse!
