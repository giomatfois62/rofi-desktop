        "description": "Jessie Wallaker is your off-brand coach and creator of the RCK SLD GYM Method, focused on creating your dream life now, being worthy of it without having done \"enough\", and healing your relationship with food, fitness and success in the process. Here she'll dump her experience and help you move through this change in the Brain Dump Diaries.\nFrom having dreams of working in the NFL as an Athletic Trainer, reaching out to head trainers in the NFL and getting responses, shadowing, working with her high school teams, and getting accepted in the oldest accredited school in the US for it, only to fall away and question every choice from there. Her passion for health and fitness went with it, as that was her main focus for control in her years of overworking, hustling and seeking pride in having no life or balance.\nNow, 5 years into realizing that looking to everyone else for motivation and \"permission\" that she's done enough, has created her own hell to have a \"rags to riches story\" to be worthy of having made it.\nShe'll break down how to create and set boundaries in work, school, business, realtionships, food and fitness. All while focusing on healing your realtionship with health to one of support rather than out-of-control destruction.\nThis movement is a smaller voice in the over-saturated environment of \"sleep when you're dead\" and \"life hacks to get more done\", but it's the one that saved her life. And she can't wait to help you through this hard but worthwhile change.",

        "description": "This program is my personal journey to breaking the life cycle you were born into to the life you choose for yourself. I overcame sexual abuse, growing up extremely poor (raised on welfare) with a single mom of 4 kids in a rural small town. I raised my siblings from 8 years old with an alcoholic parent trying to stay sober. I worked since I was eight years old, was on the verge of a nervous break down at 15. I made the heart breaking decision to preserve my sanity. I ended up moving in with a religious family at 15. This came as a bitter-sweet situation. I finally moved out on my very own and started finally my life, my way, my control. This was the beginning to the life I wanted and deserved. I had a \"normal\" life for while finally. Then I lost some key people in my finally amazing life. My whole world took a brutal turn. This came with even more brutal emotion distress. This was the beginning of my event I can only describe as a nervous break down. I tried so hard to be stronger than my body could take but I had met my limits physically and mentally. This is where I learned the hard reality that I can't take everything life throws me. I learned about what a narcissist was and how I had to set boundaries for my own self preservation. \nI want to share what I have had to learn the hard way so hopefully others will know it can be done. I also would love for people to know to set up boundaries sooner than I did. I always took pride in trying to learn life management by others \u201clife lessons\u201d. I thought I was invincible on the crap life can throw me. \u201c I can take it\u201d is my personal mantra I would tell my inner self, I learned the hard way I do have a limit on what my body can physically and mentally take to my disappointment. I guess I am only human. That sucks !!!! But it is my heartbreaking reality\u2026 that I am NOT invincible. \n\nI came from nothing and had every reason and opportunity to be a pregnant young teen with limited life options. I could have easily repeated the childhood cycle that many fall victim to. Instead, I became a survivor and took my life by the balls and said, \u201cListen bitch I\u2019m speaking\u201d.  In a nice way. Lol. We are our life choices no matter our circumstances. I am now happily married to my high school sweetheart, and we have two wonderful boys. My husband and I have been together for 30 years (and still like each other). Trust me, I want to kill him at times, but I think that is the sign of a healthy relationship. If you don\u2019t want to invoke harm (metaphorically) on your spouse here and there, then you don\u2019t care. Then you are just existing together in a house. This channel and podcast is how not to be a victim. Overcome the shit life throws you and shine like a diamond, inside and out. If you want to know how to do this in a positive, constructive, and sassy yet classy way, tune in. I am happy to share what I have learned. ",

It grows, it blooms, its beautiful, it just is!\nHappiness and Positivity are a mindset, when  planted, watered and nurtured,  they grow, when weeded and pruned, they flourish, enabling you to bloom in life. To thrive rather than survive. \nDon't be like the salmon thrashing about upstream, relax, let go and go with the flow. \nIt is not all about 6 figure incomes, sweating and stressing through life, proving you're a superwoman because look you can juggle baby, take the kids to numerous weekly activities (that they probably don't even want to do, by the way) be busy and super efficient at work, cook like Delia Smith and bake like Mary Berry and still have energy to be a loving wife, FFS*! its about enjoying the here and now. Its about aligning and finding the peace within, to be able to find your authentic voice and use it to get what you want. Its learning to say \"NO! I'm not going to do that, because it is not in line with my happiness\"  Your happiness, your joy, your  inner peace  are too important to keep at the back door, too important to brush aside and hope you'll find time for them later. \nExplore who you are, learn about you and how your mind works and learn how to embrace the wonderfulness of you, so you can get purposeful on getting more positive.

On this show, I talk to entrepreneurs about their own stories of survival and success. We discuss the players involved, the lessons learned, the strategy that helped them out of their death spirals and dive deeply into how these experiences changed the way they build and run businesses. \n\nI also urge my guests to talk more openly about how business catastrophe impacted their personal lives and mental health.\n\nEach episode will change how you see your own obstacles both personal and professional. \n\nEvery guest will teach you lessons to apply in your own life and business.

        "description": "Questions, Concerns, Comments? \nPlease email me at jmmrunningtherace@gmail.com.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________ \n    Dear Listener, \nAre you ready? There are many things in life to prepare for: college, gameday, a career, marriage, having a family, owning a home, retirement. Preparing for these endeavors is part of life\u2019s journey; personally, I have worked to prepare myself for many of them. But even more, I am in the process of preparing myself for an even greater event than getting married or owning my own home, as great as these things are. I am preparing to meet the King who is coming back someday for His people. \n\nDear Listener, my name is Josiah Moldenhauer, and the purpose of this podcast is to help you prepare as well, prepare to meet this King of the Ages who is coming soon for those who believe in Him and follow Him. Who is this King? He is also known as the King of Glory. He is the Chosen One who came to redeem us back to God from our sin and shame that we may know Him as Father and save us from Hell that we might know Heaven as home. \n\nJesus Himself tells us at the end of the book of Revelation: \u201cBehold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. \u2018I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.\u2019\u201d (Revelation 22:12-16, NIV 1984). \n\nDear Listening Friend, have you washed your sin-stained robes in the blood of the Lamb? I\u2019m so glad I have! He has forgiven and cleansed me of my sins. If you have never met the Savior, He stands at the door of your heart and knocks. Open the door to Him while there is still time; you do not want to be left outside in the dark. Hell is as terrible and real as Heaven is glorious. Jesus said, \u201cThe thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10, ESV). Jesus offers true spiritual life with God now and for eternity. He is the only one who gives living water that quenches our thirsty souls. \n\n \u201cThe Spirit [of God] and the bride say, \u201cCome!\u201d And let him who hears say, \u201cCome!\u201d Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life (Rev. 22:17, NIV). \n\nDear friend, join me on a journey of knowing and following this Jesus together as we prepare for His glorious coming! As we learn to believe in Him, to love Him with our lives, and to long for His return. Our King is coming back soon! He told us, \u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\u201d (Matt. 24:42, NIV).\n\nGrace and Peace to you in Jesus Christ the Lord. \n",

When you sync up the mind, heart, and spirit, it unlocks a whole new world. Welcome to the adventure of YOUR lifetime.  It's time to listen... doodle... and shine!\n \nSpoken Art Journaling is designed to be both meditative and mind blowing. Three years ago, Molly caught her husband staring out into space and thought for sure he must be thinking of something earth shattering. Nope! When asked what he was thinking about, he responded with, \u201cNothing.\u201d Astonished at how a person could do such a thing, his comment put her on a journey of quiet time and self-discovery. What she discovered is that thinking about nothing was not her jam. She realized that allowing her mind to express itself through color and the impressions all around her (inside & out), tapped into her heart and spirit too. She coined the technique Spoken Art Journaling and 8 journals later, she\u2019s a happier & healthier person because of it. \n\nMolly Nece is CEO of GOLDEN Age Leadership (.com) and dabbles in the spirituality side of life at MollySHINES.com.

        "title": "Maintaining Your Badassness Through Failed Relationships, Health Scares, and Life's Fuckups!",
        "description": "My name is Sherri, at age 53 I have learned the first step to maintaining your Badassness is through a healthy mind and body. I am an HR Professional for over 25 years and I own and operate a business for just as long.  I have completed my BS in Organizational Leadership and my MS in Leadership Development from Wright-State University. I have learned through trials and tribulations to maintain a healthy mind and body. Before you can maintain a healthy body, you must be in the correct mindset because they work together to keep you grounded. After years of suffering with arthritis and headaches from an almost fatal car accident, and years of fluctuating weight I wanted to have more control over my being. I began mediating in 2020 and trying to eat healthier, and I became certified in nutrition and personal training.  Now, I am not saying that I have mastered the gut, but I have made significant improvements to my health which is connected to the mind. After suffering for years with arthritis, headaches, and fluctuating weight loss.   Another way to maintaining your brain function or having a healthier brain Is through learning.  You don\u2019t have to wait for permission or for the education fund to be approved by your organization to get those back pocket skills. Back pocket skills are skills you obtain when they are not required for work or skills that are opposite from your 9-5 job. Becoming a mentor is one of the most fulfilling back pocket skills you can obtain. Unfortunately, most people with color lack the knowledge of a professional mentor or even know the definition of one. I did not get one until my early thirties, so I want to share my professional experience with you and help you become the best version of yourself.\nMarriage, cheating, and lying are some of the questions we get on our other forums.  Many questions have been asked of us such as:\n1. Should I forgive my husband for cheating on me and having a baby with a stripper? What will that do to me emotionally?\n2. I married my cheating husband twice, and after our second divorce he told me he never stopped cheating.  This is 12 years our second marriage.\n3. Why do some people call white women Karens? I have seen black women act worse, are they called Shaniquas? \n4. I forgave my husband for cheating and four years later I ended up in the ER with flu like symptoms.  After several hours, the doctor comes out and tells me that I have AIDS.\nWe can all use constructive advice and friends that will come to our rescue when we need emotional support. Let's help each other throughout these tough situations and learn together to maintain our sanity.  Every one of us can use encouragement!\nSo, come on and let's take this journey together and Maintain Our Badassness!",

Here, we will discuss mid-life everything, so buckle up, friends! \n\nDo you love to bake or cook? I don't love cooking or baking, but I can cook and bake. My family loves my cooking, and I honestly love eating, so let's share recipes. Plus, what a great excuse to get great cooks and chefs here on the pod who can help us spice things up in the kitchen. If you're at all curious about how we will cook together, then stay tuned, my friends, because we are going to cook up some fun here on the Call me Camille Podcast!  \n\nFinally, I will share everyday truths and encouragement with you from God's Word as a therapist and friend.

Through time we grow, we fall in love, we get to hate and forgive. Time is the healer of all good and bad, time is the healer and the killer, and it is our responsibility to take action and do something with this time, all that we experience is a direct consequence of how we utilize the time that is given to us, and so, The Time Podcast was born. \n\nThe Time Podcast was created in an attempt to offer motivation, direction and a getaway from the standards that society sets. My desire is to grow together with my audience and go through the \"challenges\" and \"failures\" of life with a smile on our faces. \n\nThat being said, if you are ready to change your life and take advantage of all of the doors that time opens and closes, to realize that you are a beautiful creation of time and you have been given this gift of life, tune in to The Time Podcast!\n\nFollow Andrei on Instagram @vovcenco https://www.instagram.com/vovcenco/",

We view mental health in a state a public health crisis caused by the collective trauma of capitalism. The mental health industry in the US largely serves to uphold capitalist power structures and manage reactions to capitalist oppression. The series starts off with an overview and discussion of the book Psychiatric Hegemony which critiques the power structure of mental health professionals and the profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry. Future discussions may center around teach ins, collective trauma, public mental health education, community mental health, personal experiences, scientific research, mental health behaviors, neurodiversity, or other topics related to liberation from the current model of psychiatry.\n\nWhile we do recognize the pain and suffering at the individual level and that individuals have benefitted from interventions within the mental health care system, this podcast is best suited for individuals ready to critique the power structure and imagine the future of mental health from a revolutionary perspective. This podcast will touch high-level on many potentially triggering topics including but not limited to sexuality, violence, racism, misogyny, substance use, and any number of atrocities.",

        "description": "My podcasts are about the everyday life struggles some of us encounter and are forced to deal with on our own. My podcasts are for people like myself, the 'underdogs', people who go through things in life who have to fight their battles alone, who don't have anyone else except themselves for (emotional) support of any kind. If you are a person who's faced with more trials and tribulations in your everyday life than the average person does, then these podcasts are for you. If you suffer from mental health issues that stem from wrong that's been done to you and have no one to talk to or you think or feel that no one understands what you're going through, if you feel your life consists of nothing but unfair and negative challenges that you always seem to end up on the loosing end of & your constantly misjudged by those around you - especially people you thought would understand, these podcasts are for you. \nLife isn't always fair, that's just the way it goes, but for some people life seems to be truly and constantly unfair all the way around. After a while it takes a serious toll on you & it affects us in unimaginable ways, mentally, physically, emotionally & sometimes even sociably & when you don't have anyone except yourself to rely on, times that are already difficult to deal with or get through become 10 times harder. We don't always have the right answers to the issues that life can bring, we just do the best we can with what we have - & sometimes all we have is ourselves to get us by & if you know like I know, even though all we have in the end are ourselves, the flip side (truth) is, no one is meant to get through this thing called life alone, but for some of us, people like myself, we're forced to. My podcasts aren't for the 'elite', meaning, it's not for people who don't have these kind of problems or people who have been through something at some point in their life & have come out on 'top' & it all worked out to their benefit in the end, no. These podcasts are for 'us', the 'underdogs' - people who fight just to get by but just can't seem to 'get ahead' because everything that life continues to serve up to them is just one fucked up issue after another that continues to knock you down. Of course when you get knocked down you get back up, you have to, but people need to realize that even though you get back up after being knocked down, every knock down leaves you wounded & when getting knocked down is one right behind the other, as you continue to 'get back up', you're not getting up with as much strength as you had before & when it continues to happen (& often), yes you get back up, but the fight in you continues to weaken which means, the next 'knock down' is going to take more of a toll on your inner strength than you may have to give. \nPeople who don't have these types of issues, or have been through things in their life where getting up wasn't as difficult after a few 'knock downs' will not be able to relate to my podcasts, & that's ok because these podcast are not for you so the judgements, feel free to keep to yourself or go enjoy another channel that applies to you. People LOVE judging others, especially when your problems aren't theirs but that's not right. My podcasts offer compassion & understanding to the 'underdogs' - people who's life's are unfairly judged by others - other's usually sitting in a very comfortable position who have the audacity to look or talk down on or about others who are not as 'fortunate' as they are. Believe me when I tell you that I understand how it feels to be an 'underdog' & my podcasts are for us.\n\nDisclaimer: I am no scholar, I am no Dr. Phil, I am just a regular everyday person who's dealing with life and the issues I'm dealt the best way I can, alone. Although alone is not the way I choose to deal with my life issues, it's the way I'm forced to deal with them.",

I\u2019ve found that in the business world there are stories that we\u2019ve heard since childhood that we need to be tough, masculine, and lead from this place of fear. And this podcast is offering a new voice to look at business and life through the lens of love and compassion. These will be stories for you to see yourself in, learn from, or hear a different perspective. I invite you to listen with an open heart and mind.  \n\nWith love,\nBetta Entwistle",

        "description": "During my ongoing journey of recovery I have met more and more people who have been sexually abused in one way or another. Statistics say that 1 woman out of 5 has experience some type of sexual assault and 1 out of 3 between the ages of 11 & 17. Statistics also show that 1 out of 4 men experience some type of sexual abuse in their lifetime and the same ratio as women for young men between the ages of 11 & 17. We all can find statistics in various places, and these can also be different; but you know what? We are not a number, we are human beings who know that we are part of these groups of people who are the making of the stats. We are humans, we are men and women who want to belong to something else other than statistics. We are individuals who need to not feel lonely, alone, ashamed, fearful, abandoned and forgotten. This podcast is for you, for my fellow humans who feel the deepest feelings that sexual abuse has brought to our lives. You are not alone and although I can't promise that you will feel better after listening to this podcast, I feel enormous hope that you will find in these stories some comfort in knowing that you are never alone and that better times are to come.\nemail: powerinsurviving@gmail.com ",

As a Clinical mental health counselor and a person who has lived in survival mode most of my life - I have learned to reclaim my power to self love, self care, healing, wellness, and personal development. I wanted a platform to be able to share these topics in a digestible and relatable way. We\u2019ll be deep diving into an array of psychology, self help, and personal development books where I share therapeutic key points and cover an assortment of topics. I\u2019m grateful you\u2019re taking this journey with me and excited to see how far we can go together.

In this podcast I talk about my lived experience of being an autistic+ADHD person growing up in a world built for neurotypicals. I also host guests to talk about their own personal lived experiences with neurodiversity, as every neurodistinct person is different and experiences neurodiversity in their own unique ways. My goal is to provide relatable content for other neurodistinct folks and also to educate neurotypicals about Autism, ADHD and other neurotypes, while also trying to show how neurodistinct people can thrive if provided the right environment and properly accommodated, rather than treated as broken puzzle pieces that need to be fixed. *I am not a professional and do not represent the viewpoint of all neurodistinct people, I am just one neurodistinct person speaking about Autism and ADHD from my personal lived experiences, as well as the personal lived experiences of my guests.</p><p>*Check out the portuguese version of this podcast, \"Explicando Neurodiversidade\", and my second podcast \"Talking Weather\" (both are available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts)</p><p>Feel free to contact me at ginhobeleza@gmail.com with any comments or inquiries related to this podcast :)</p>",

I have learned, and will continue to learn how to lead better life. Given both time and ability, I will make all my valuable thoughts publicaly available.

After years of climbing the corporate ladder and later co-founding startups, he has shifted his career towards sharing his enthusiastic approach to meditation practice. Ranga's teaching style entails bringing the ancient wisdom of the Buddha to the modern ear, through personal stories and contemporary similes. </p><p>Rather than offering a singular, rigid view, he believes that we each hold the authority to find our authentic path in life and to deeply free ourselves up from worrying, anger, doubt, dullness and a sense of lacking. As such, he approaches his role as a teacher with an open heart; open to all the particularities, experiences and uniqueness of each student. He draws on over 20 years of meditation practice and a lifetime of learning from Buddhist (and a few Daoist) meditation masters to guide students on their personal journeys towards what they yearn for.</p>",

And I know we can come out the other side much more prepared to face our current challenges while finding some variation of peace that allows us to continuously and positively move forward.\n\nI also offer sage advice that may be of benefit to many...\n\nJoin me for a few minutes, and I am sure you will stay for the entire segment.\n\nThank you, and you are welcome.\n ",

        "description": "<p>A podcast about mental health, neurodiversity, and changing our perspective when life brings us challenges, in order to heal and thrive! My name is Leslie Reyes, and I'm the author of the IndieBRAG award-winning Amazon best-seller, \"The Zen of Learning to Ride a Motorcycle: How I Faced My Fears, Shifted Gears, and Found Healing from Anxiety, Codependency, and Depression.\" I have worked as a psychiatric and chemical dependency nurse, yoga teacher, and I'm also a motorcycle enthusiast. I have seen mental illness up close, first as the daughter of a schizophrenic mother and later through my own personal mental health struggles. I never expected a motorcycle would one day be the guru I needed to change my life habits and finally learn to trust myself. I live with my husband, our five motorcycles, and two dogs in Northern California. This is a podcast about mental health, neurodiversity, and changing our perspective when life brings us challenges, in order to heal and thrive! (This podcast is not a substitute for mental health care or autism treatment).

My goal is to create more conversation around this huge transition in life. Each episode will be filled with experiences and advice from many different athletes.

This action targeted six Swift & Co. meat packaging plants across the country and resulted in nearly 1,300 arrests. Hundreds of people without documentation were deported in connection to the raids, and although the raid was over in a day the fracturing of families and communities left a lasting mark.\u00a0\n\nSolo \u00c9ramos Ni\u00f1os takes a deep dive into one of the targeted communities and seeks to understand the ways the raid tore into the lives of the children and families that bore witness to it all. The series also examines ways community members have sought to fortify and uplift one another in the aftermath of the raid and what actions can be taken to protect our children moving forward.\n\nJoin hosts, Shelby and Angel Lopez, as they explore the nuances of immigration, Latine culture, first generations, mental health, and hoping for a better life for those that will come after us.\u00a0",

        "description": "El cambio psicol\u00f3gico no es algo f\u00e1cil de conseguir. Modificar nuestras tendencias, nuestros h\u00e1bitos de pensamientos, sistemas de creencias, conceptos aprendidos sobre nosotros mismos y los dem\u00e1s, etc. requiere mucho trabajo. M\u00e1s a\u00fan, cuando a trav\u00e9s de muchos de estos procesos y aprendizajes, hemos logrado algunos objetivos o nos hemos protegido. Dejar lo que creemos que es seguro a pesar de que nos genere gran dolor o ansiedad no resulta sencillo.\nC\u00f3mo terapeuta, me gustar\u00eda tener las claves milagrosas para dotar a todos de un cambio r\u00e1pido, pero la realidad no es esa. No existen f\u00e1rmacos, terapias, aparatos o energ\u00edas paranormales capaces de producir el cambio psicol\u00f3gico y emocional en una persona de manera inminente. \nLa resiliencia, como hoy d\u00eda leemos, no es algo fortuito, ni m\u00e1gico. La resiliencia es un proceso a trav\u00e9s del cual, una persona va aceptando, asimilando, comprendiendo y elaborando aquellas experiencias qu\u00e9 por su intensidad o frecuencia, pudieron llegar a ser traum\u00e1ticas, hasta el punto, que finalmente consigue flexibilizar e integrar lo que ocurri\u00f3 a su vida, permiti\u00e9ndole adaptarse a su nueva situaci\u00f3n y circunstancia. La persona resiliente no olvida, no pretende dejar a un lado las cosas que vivi\u00f3 por muy duras que fuesen, no responsabiliza a los dem\u00e1s, las circunstancias o la luna, de sus fracasos. El RESILIENTE, es aquella persona que toma lo que ocurre como una experiencia m\u00e1s de su vida, se permite sentir y atiende a su emoci\u00f3n de manera consciente hasta llegar a comprender los hechos y as\u00ed mismo.  Trata el proceso como un aprendizaje donde cada decisi\u00f3n le va llevando a nuevas respuestas que finalmente desencadenan en nuevas opciones que le permiten ir adaptando lo que el fue a lo que \u00e9l es, seg\u00fan el momento que le est\u00e1 tocando vivir. La persona resiliente, con cada experiencia, va alcanzando madurez, sabidur\u00eda, consiguiendo obtener una mirada del mundo, su entorno y su persona m\u00e1s universal y capaz. Se vuelve m\u00e1s eficiente con la edad y los a\u00f1os.  \nLa persona que se sobrepone a una violaci\u00f3n, a un accidente de tr\u00e1fico grave, un c\u00e1ncer, una ruptura, la perdida de un empleo, no lo hace de inmediato, como creemos, no puede no sentir el dolor de la perdida, la rabia, el p\u00e1nico ante lo que viene despu\u00e9s del hecho. Es falso que puede evitar pensamientos negativos e intrusivos, es m\u00e1s, se har\u00e1n reiterativos, persistentes y hasta obsesivos. El que se sobrepone, es el que decide mirar a la vida en su plenitud, aceptando la contrariedad, comprendiendo como la emoci\u00f3n humana es de gran ayuda para su adaptaci\u00f3n, el que se permite elaborar los hechos con paciencia hasta encontrar la calma suficiente para tomar decisiones que le permitan adaptarse y abrir el principio del camino de su recuperaci\u00f3n. Sobreponerse o cambiar psicol\u00f3gicamente, es un esfuerzo consciente desde la humildad, el conocimiento, la experiencia constante, el desarrollo de un trabajo sostenido y creativo en el tiempo y, sobre todo, teniendo como principio el AMOR A UNO MISMO.  PRACTICA LA VIDA DESDE EL AMOR A TI MISMO.\n",

You don\u2019t talk about it, you don\u2019t share it for the fear that if people knew, It would be the end, the end of your job, your relationships, it would be the end of everything you\u2019ve been building. So you wake up, smile, and go about your day and it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got broad shoulders because you\u2019re carrying the weight of your hidden truth all day long. Unnecessarily. \n\nThis is how we, Topher and Jamie, felt for years of our lives, our secrets were different, our coping mechanisms were different, our stories were different, but the SHAME was the exact same. When we finally couldn\u2019t take it any more and asked for help, shared our secrets, the end of days we were sure were coming never came, in its place was a warm embrace, encouragement, praise, the truth no longer weighed us down, we were free.\n\nTeaTox was forged in the fire of the silent rage, fear and shame that weighed us down and then was extinguished by the love and peace we received when we started sharing. Come listen to us share our story, and hear how other people dealt with their insecurities, addiction and everything in between. The power is in the permission to be vulnerable. You cannot fight what you cannot see, so listen, open up, and let\u2019s get to work.",

        "description": "<p>Prescription drugs in 2022 were over $100B in the United States and still can't heal all people! God does not want you to stay sick, suffering or in chronic pain. The medical industry is not at fault, they are doing their best within their education and certifications, but there are so many areas that God can use for your specific healing. Never Give Up!</p><p><strong>My Podcast Episodes, \"Healing Inspirations for the Body &amp; Mind,\" are of God's helping hands for your healing and for you to at least, \"Feel Better than You did Yesterday!\"</strong> I do not discuss or recommend medications but share teachings that have been inspired by God for me and to teach others. They are spiritual and address your internal being; once you receive emotional healing, insight and awareness inside, more healing comes to your physical body. As you read and listen, I ask God by His Spirit to enlighten your eyes and heart for wisdom, understanding and power to be well and healthy!</p><p>Podcast #1, \"The Healing Train,\" was one of my first teaching videos on healing a few years ago and in 2022 I published, \"Be Healed While Waiting To Be Healed.\" I highly recommend you to order this book!

This would lead some people to give up, but not me. I have raised thousands of pounds over the last 30 years, doing everything from stand-up, singing with local bands and comedy drag. When I was forced to give up my favorite sport of fishing, and my drag work because of my health, I became an author, and now have 12 self-published books of different genres, all available on Amazon.

Mindfulness, meditation, breathing, calming, grounding techniques and motivation are all utilized. The foundation of Reigning In Light is peace. The core of it, is acceptance. And the intention of it, is to welcome the spirit to guide us. Reigning In Light looks at members of the human species as both a unique individual and a being with similar desires and characteristics to others with a need to not only contribute to the whole but gain from it as well. Reigning In Light is meant to be food for the soul and is filled with metaphors and analogies. It is a unification tactic with the universe. It is a remembrance of our inner connectivity to the earth and beyond. Reigning In light supports the straightening of our crown and the walking with our heads held high. It is not a replacement for therapy. The podcast begins with an introductory pilot that is more meditative than the subsequent episodes, which are topic based and an idea of spiritual health. It is a partner in solitude, a moment of gratitude and a challenger of isolation.</p><p>At this time, listeners can expect new episodes once per week.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.reigninginlight.org\">www.reigninginlight.org</a></p><p>Subscribe, like, share and comment on:</p><p>Youtube:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ReigningInLight\">https://www.youtube.com/@ReigningInLight</a></p><p>Follow me at:</p><p>Facebook:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092187452316\">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092187452316</a></p><p>Instagram:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reigninginlight/\">https://www.instagram.com/reigninginlight/</a></p><p></p><p>Twitter:</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReigningInLight\">https://twitter.com/ReigningInLight</a></p><p></p><p>TikTok:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.tiktok.com/@reigninginlight\">www.tiktok.com/@reigninginlight</a></p><p></p><p>Original music Reigning In Light by Mojo Wired.</p><p>\u00a9 2023 R.L.B., Reign, Reigning In Light.

Undesirable noise, like air and vehicle traffic that doesn\u2019t disturb sleep can still affect sleep by changing the time we spend in different sleep stages, increasing lighter sleep stages and decreasing more restorative slow wave and REM sleep. Noises during sleep may increase secretion of hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol and elevate heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>Short-term, fatigue, irritability, and poorer mental health are associated with exposure to nighttime noise. Long-term, poor quality sleep due to noise can have a number of adverse effects \u2013 heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, weight gain, increased use of sleep medications , decreased overall health, and certain types of cancer.</p><p>A very popular solution is to mask unwanted noise with a more desirable acoustic environment. Many find that masking background noise helps to distract from anxious or intrusive thoughts and readies the mind for sleep. The sounds found to be universally most effective are:</p><p>* Classic White Noise</p><p>* Ocean Waves &amp; Beach Sounds</p><p>* Raindrops &amp; Flowing Water</p><p>* Woods &amp; Wilderness</p><p>* Relaxing Music</p><p>* Pink Noise</p><p>* Soothing Voices</p>",

Then, what if we could magically free these inner parts from their darkness and transform them back into wise powers and guides?</p><p>These transformations and more you will hear on DARK LIGHT TRUTH, hosted by Emily Eldredge, the creator of the Drawing Out Process\u00ae and the ChangeLight System\u2122.</p><p><strong>In this podcast, you will hear <em>real</em> people go through <em>actual</em> sessions of The Drawing Out Process\u00ae - Emily's 7-step emotional healing technique in which a person \u201cdraws out\u201d, talks with, and fully heals an inner part (or parts) at the core of their struggle. In other words, we dive into their darkness, reclaim their light, and reveal their Truth.</strong></p><p>Every session contains a fascinating new mystery to unravel, compelling us to investigate:</p><ol><li><p><em>What</em> or <em>who</em> inside the person is causing the struggle?</p></li><li><p><em>Why</em> is it there? What experiences or events made it feel so unsafe that it got distorted by fear and fell into darkness in the first place?</p></li><li><p><em>How</em> is it trying to protect the person \u2013 or itself \u2013 whatever ways it knows?</p></li></ol><p>Once we hear <em>its</em> stories and <em>its</em> truths, we then rescue it from the darkness. That is, we heal it by freeing it of its fear and reactivity so that it no longer hurts the person. We then re-align it with the person\u2019s desires and Truth so that, together, they can move forward feeling more whole, clear, radiant, and at peace.</p><p><strong>Every session is filled with surprising epiphanies, twists, and turns. We never know <em>what</em> will we encounter - nor <em>who</em>.</strong></p><p>Will choking fogs, thick walls, or seething bodyguards try to bar the way? Will we open cardboard boxes, enter looming castles, or peer into dark caves? Will we face fire-breathing dragons, sinister demons, or crying little boys and girls? It will all depend on what parts formed inside that person in reaction to their life experiences and on what their inner wisdom deems is ready to be seen and healed, once and for all.</p><p>Join Emily for a fascinating new mystery every week, a new search-and-rescue mission, a new adventure into the heart of humanity\u2019s darkness to reveal its truths and to witness inner darkness quickly and miraculously transform back to inner light.</p><p><strong>Who knows?

Not Perfect from Hot Mess to Life Success.</em> Born in a Brooklyn, NY Housing project she came of age during the dawn of the hip hop era and the emergence of the crack epidemic. Pregnant at 13, baby at 14, a college student at 16, dismissed from college at 18, and college graduate at 23, Dr. Shai knows the ups and downs of life from her formative young adult experiences. Now, this seasoned executive with a doctorate in law and policy, who is a successful author, speaker, entrepreneur, career/life strategist, non-profit board member, wife, and mom of three is here to share with women how to fail without being a failure. By telling her bold, transformative story, including her addiction to alcohol and hydrocodone at the height of her career she provides a roadmap for women on how to get free of self-blame, trauma, and shame that led to her struggles with perfectionism and imposter syndrome. Dr. Shai was on the killer quest for perfection until she learned that getting \u201cbetter\u201d was the true end game to abundant living. In her inaugural memoir, Better. Not Perfect: From Hot Mess to Life Success, she focuses her attention on women who are willing to find the courage to ultimately learn themselves, love themselves to be themselves, unapologetically.

However, if this person does not give your child any care then you can always report it to your community leader or just explain the situation, your community leader will take the case to headquarters, and they will deal with the situation.</p><p></p><p>And the second point today is, being informed is the best weapon these days, as parents should know that their children need to be vaccinated on time and be informed to ensure that and many other health services, I want to count briefly as a mother saved her son from having Covid-19</p><p></p><p><em>\u201cCount the history -Be briefly-\u201d</em></p><p></p><p>This story is about how a mother was misinformed about a third COVID-19 vaccine and her son was about to have it again, however thanks to the help of her community leader and the good disposition of the medical staff, She was able to realize several things like for example on the UNICEF page monthly uploads calendars with vaccination dates and the name of the vaccine, similarly on many reliable health pages you can find information of new diseases.</p><p></p><p>I know that as parents care about their children, and in the same way I know that health systems should do it equally, however, I invite you to see weekly the Web page of WHO and UNICEF where you will find the right information and more, for today this has been everything, have a happy day, this is being safe and healthy.</p>",

This is not your normal self help podcast because I will be discussing real topics that go unspoken. I want to bring back those discussions that fuel passion and ideas, while bringing awareness to self for accountability to be learned and shared. During your journey ascending to living in abundance you will begin to bring forth all you desire, from dreams to reality. I will guide you with real answers to help facilitate more positive thinking of self and self awareness.  I record raw and uncut, and it could be in any environment. Here\u2019s a taste of what real sounds like! Peace and Love</p>",

The most rewarding part of this process for us is introducing you to yourself and watching you start to nurture and value yourself. For instance, we are going to show some how to lose the victim mentality and watch you all evolve into victors.</p><p>We are so blessed to be on this journey with you as this, my friend, will be the most important work you will ever do. Once your mental operating system is functioning at a higher capacity, everything else follows suit. Please trust me, the work is tough but so rewarding. Personally, I have been doing this work for over 20 years and I didn't have access to a coach. Rather, it happened very organically in my life. The work began with a will to just survive circumstances.

What happened along yoga's winding path from the caves and forests of the sages to the gyms, hospitals and village halls of the modern West?This comprehensive history sets yoga in its global cultural context for the first time. It leads us on a fascinating journey across the world, from arcane religious rituals and medieval body-magic, through muscular Christianity and the British Raj, to the Indian nationalist movement and the arrival of yoga in the twentieth-century West. We discover how the practice reached its present-day ubiquity and how it became embedded in powerful social currents shaping the world's future, such as feminism, digital media, celebrity culture, the stress pandemic and the quest for an authentic identity in the face of unprecedented change.Shearer's revealing history boasts a colorful cast of characters past and present, who tell an engaging tale of scholars and scandal, science and spirit, wisdom and waywardness.

If you are scared, what does it feel like in your gut?  Is that feeling good for you?  Let's dig into this deeper. How long is your list of fears? If it is very short, you have to be an extraordinarily happy person!  If your list is long, are you feeling sad and depressed? When we listen to the media what do we hear?  The media believes fear sells! My podcast is my belief people want to find hope...for themselves, for their kids, and for their friends.  Why wouldn't they?  Why wouldn't you?  How do we find hope? I will give part of the answer now.  Fear is an irrational feeling.  Hope is a rational choice.  In order to go from fear to hope requires a change...a change in your beliefs.  And the person to start with is you.  Does this make sense?</p>",
