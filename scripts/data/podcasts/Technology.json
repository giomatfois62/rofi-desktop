Join us for lively discussion of relevant topics, poignant interviews, and for recommendations on tech tools that will help you create the inclusive environments that you seek in your classrooms and beyond. \n\nKate Huttenlocher, MA, LLPC (she/her/hers)\n\nWorking toward open mindedness, inclusivity, and being able to meet people where they are at has been a part of my journey at every step both personally and professionally. After working in K-8 education for a time, I decided to pursue a Master\u2019s in Counseling from Oakland University. It was at this point that I began working as a graduate assistant in e-Learning before becoming full time staff of Oakland University\u2019s e-Learning and Instructional Support office during the COVID-19 pandemic. I have been serving as the Assistant Manager of Support Services at e-LIS since January 2021. Working in e-Learning has given me the opportunity to explore the ways in which we can make education more inclusive and accessible for all students. Outside of work, I enjoy frequenting local coffee shops, spending time with my cats, and am an avid podcast listener. \n\nDan Arnold, Ph.D. (he/him/his)\n\nI\u2019m Dr. Dan and I\u2019m the Manager of Support Services for Oakland University\u2019s e-Learning and Instructional Support team. With over 17 years of higher education experience ranging from student financial aid, to student recruitment, to online learning, I have worked with a wide range of students and colleagues over the years. My journey toward learning more about inclusion started while working on my doctorate, and has continued to this day. I enjoy thinking about and enacting ways for all learning environments to be more inclusive. On a personal note, I like snacks, sports, and dogs. \n\nKayla Yucha (she/her/hers)\n\nI am Kayla and I am a junior year marketing student at Oakland University! I currently work at the e-Learning and Instructional Support office as their lead tech on the team, and this is my third year working at the office. Living on campus, and working with the campus community everyday at e-LIS has furthered my passion for cultivating inclusivity within both the technology realm and in everyday life. During my free time, I enjoy reading, all things fashion, and crocheting! \n",

An artificial presenter talks to artificial chatbots. Why? In order to establish the boundary that separates human from machine intelligence. It's funny. It's thought provoking. It dramatises what chatbots can and cannot do. It's a revelation! The sudden popularity of artificial intelligence programs has created a massive use of Chatbots to do all sorts of tasks from writing school and university essays to generating computer code. It\u2019s said that in America a chatbot has passed the American bar exam. (Bear in mind, that may just be a rumour put about by chatbots. Which in itself may be even more alarming if they\u2019re starting to manage their own reputations.) In any event, white collar professionals believe their jobs are about to be taken over by machines. This podcast may be reassuring in one way. Because we see that chatbots can make complete idiots of themselves. But it's also true that . . . THEY'RE COMING! Don\u2019t believe me? Don\u2019t want to believe me? Can\u2019t believe they\u2019re really that good? Let's talk to them and find out!</p>",
