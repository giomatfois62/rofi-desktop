Marriage and raising a family isn't about acheiving perfection but rather solidifying the foundation their home is built on as they spiritually fight for their children and the generations to follow. Spiritual leadership and discipleship should be priority in the home. Through this passion, they started a nonprofit men's minsitry in 2014 which they operate in the southeastern United States. They use the outdoors as a platform to challenge and equip men to be spiritual leaders in their home. In 2022, they also released a 30 days men's devotion called \"The Hands of a Warrior.\" \n\nJoin M.A. and Chelsea bi-weekly as they explore challenging topics they experience through marriage, parenting, and relationships. They hope to make you laugh through relatable moments while also inviting you to join in on the spiritual discussions.",

We talk about the techniques that we have used over the last twenty five plus years to take great bucks on film with bows. We will give you information on land layouts, tips like mock scrapes, foodplotting, timberstand improvement. Things we have used to take well over two hundred plus deer on film over the years. We came up with this idea to help everyone become a more effective hunter, and to help boost your success in the woods. We are looking forward to helping everyone to have a more fulfilling hunt at every level. Our back ground we have worked in the hunting industry in many levels for over 25yrs. We did the TV thing we worked for Summit treestands on their TV show Summit high place for years. When they sold the company we moved on to our own company RushOutdoorswi, then the Obsession TV which allot of you watched on the hunt channel. Our show The whitetail Obsession was quite popular. When we seen how the decline of the shows at that level was changing, and not representing the everyday hunter we started RushOutdoorswi YouTube channel. A channel for real hunts with well over three hundred hunts it has become quite popular also. We thank all of you for the success. Thank You! We have now been asked to do podcasts on many different aspects of hunting, and to share our 25 plus years each of  hunting knowledge to help everyone become a better hunters. We believe that we can help more people become successful at this level, and are excited about this new venture. We are excited to hear your questions, and give you the answers that we believe will help you get the buck of a lifetime! Remember you can listen right here, Apple Pocast, Goggle Podcast, Iheartradio Podcast, Spotify Podcast, and ask questions.

For millennia, humans spent 90% of their lives outside. Today, they spend 90% inside. It\u2019s no wonder so many feel out of balance and disconnected from their essential nature. Recent scientific studies prove what many have long suspected: that more time outside makes the modern human happier, healthier and more fulfilled. In the Open Air Humans podcast, Emmy award winning host Jesse Roesler uncovers the stories that led outdoor luminaires to spend a substantial amount of their time in wild places and the ultimate impact it\u2019s had on their lives. Along the way, guests share actionable advice, rituals, insights, favorite gear and destinations that can help us all live a better life outside.</p>",
