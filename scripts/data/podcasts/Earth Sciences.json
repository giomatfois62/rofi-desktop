Gemma came up with the idea that maybe others might like to listen to the non stop conversations they still have all these years later about the weather.\n\nOver the years they have forecast for festivals, farming, road, rail, energy, media, aviation and even the humble ice cream demand forecast and so much more. They have gone through job changes, life changes and delved in and out of many hobbies and somehow the weather still weaves in and out of their lives. \n\nSo this podcast is for anyone who would like to join our weather conversations and wherever the jet stream may take us!\n                                   \nWe hope you join us for our bi weekly chat and leave each episode loving the weather just that little bit more.",

It\u2019s complex, abstract but the impact is very real and every single person on planet Earth is concerned. The story tends to be pretty gloomy but four keen Imperial College beans pursuing a master in Climate Change, Management and Finance decided to shift the narrative. Down to Earth is a podcast which aims at reuniting people on our power to act together. Through different episodes, Danielle, Marie, Chris and Anne-Laure go beyond the infuriating climate news and critically look at how sustainability is approached in different local contexts. Curiosity and climate justice are at the very heart of this podcast. We believe a better understanding of different and unknown realities allows for a stronger collective action on climate change.",

While his pregnant wife Agnes is struck with a deadly illness back home, Shipley struggles to understand the horrifying reason why the leaders of the military have made his mission so vital. This full-length audiobook, performed by the author, uses interviews, historic newspaper and magazine articles, long-lost letters, and records from the National Archives to tell a true story of love, loss, and a forgotten Air Force mission that changed the world.",

This leaves individuals feeling excluded, negatively impacting their relationship with science. The aim of this project is to get more people, especially those in rural communities, to engage with science. For this project, I have created a podcast mini-series highlighting the ways that science impacts our daily lives. Episodes include How the Internet Connects Us, The Importance of Improving Water Quality, and Why the Scientific Method Isn\u2019t Just for Scientists. In order to cater this podcast to rural communities, I have partnered with various public libraries across the state of Iowa to establish content areas of interest and ways to reach their patrons. The podcasts consist of interviews with professionals and faculty at the University of Iowa that have extensive experience in the areas of interest. These short episodes are intended to be easily digestible in order to get people excited about science and how it works without us even knowing.",

Get the Lead Out is a chronical of the environmental degradation of a water shed and its deadly impact on an indigenous population.

This podcast follows his journey from boyhood, hunting and trapping in the Torne Valley of Ramapo where he first discovered Ford Motor Company\u2019s pollution of the watershed, and on to the culmination of a Forty-million-dollar clean-up. Along the way we are introduced to members of the Ramapough Lunaape Nation, as well as citizen scientists, archaeologists, herpetologists, engineers, politicians, journalists, and Dr. Steads students who experienced what it means to speak truth-to-power.
