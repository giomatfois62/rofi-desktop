His well-meaning father had bankrupted the family company and their fortune was gone.  His beautiful girlfriend who loved him instead of his money left him too.  Would this rich kid sink or swim?\n\nWhen we catch up with Parker Duque he\u2019s completing the sale of his real estate interests to his partners/employers, \u201cthe best f***ing day of his life.\u201d  This rich kid, against all odds, has become a self-made man. \n\nThe euphoria of renewed self-worth wouldn\u2019t last though, as Parker finds out his wife is cheating on him, and the world is about to be blown in two -- by aliens.  Can you imagine what it must be like to have everything, lose it, build it back yourself through years and years of hard work and struggle, and then lose it yet again?  But this time you were losing it because aliens were going to blow the earth in two?  Aliens?  It was hard for Parker too.  \n\nWith only a week (or two) left, would Parker Duque save the planet?  \n\n\u201cF*** that.\u201d  Parker Duque was a realist.  There were several things Parker wanted to do with his last two weeks on Earth but first he had to escape \u201cThe Nest\u201d where he\u2019s being held by Dusty and Peaches, an odd pair of government agents.  Peaches, despite her morbid obesity, was an impossibly athletic, accomplished hitwoman, and Dusty, despite his small stature, had a vise-like grip and moved through the shadows like a gazelle, a tiny gazelle.  She was the largest woman in comfort shoes he had ever seen, and Parker knew she and the tiny man with the quick temper would prove to be a formidable duo...\n\nCan Parker Escape?  What will he do if he does?  Is it really the end of the world?  Buckle up because there\u2019s so much more, and it\u2019s a wild and hilarious ride the entire way through\u2026\n",

Despite the increase in unexplainable disasters and missing people, the U.S. government's own \"Council of Human Development\" has made no moves since the 1980's. So, a member of the DoE tries yet again to form an underground group aimed at protecting people before it's too late. Too bad it's these guys... This is a set of test recordings from a homebrew modern world based on mythos built up over 2 unrecorded campaigns (technically 1 and 1/2, since the \"second\" campaign used the same characters). System used is Monster of the Week, a Powered by The Apocalypse game created by Michael Sands. It's been heavily customized and most likely none of us are following the rules as intended. Note: A lot of the beginning of this was recorded on a 15 dollar recorder. Everyone makes mouth noises even when we try not to, and hopefully over time I will be able to make the players stop chewing on all of the equipment and hitting each other. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

Discuss everyday life situations, art, movies, contests, and roast them. </p><p>I think we need to get acquainted a little bit better. I was born as a very chubby kid, my mother did not know whether she delivered a baby, or a planet. My chemistry teacher put my name in a periodic table of elements under the heavy metal group. I was the only kid ay my school who played Saturn without the ring, as it just did not fit! I left Azerbaijan when I was 16, because my father said that the economy of Azerbaijan was not strong to feed me any more... </p><p>Interested in finding out more?

Come to think of it, I already know it's unique as there wasn't a category for this type of podcast, and I'm not too sure why. I am going to explain what I see (narrate - for those not in the know) a movie and you are going to safely listen. Together we will get you home with your head full of wonder and mystery. That I can guarantee. I should just let you know I might say a swear word on occasion (don't know if I should tick the explicit content box for that...) but if I see rude bits - you will truly have to use your imagination because I will not be going into detail, I may just cough a bit. I have children and I don't want them to think I'm on some sort of seedy side hustle, especially given my voice. There is a 4000 character maximum but I don't think I can fill it so instead of waffling (which I don't often do - so you'll be fine), we'll get right to it - Valerie takes you to the movies.

Les histoires de pouvoirs surnaturels et d'\u00eatres aux capacit\u00e9s extraordinaires peuvent \u00e9veiller en nous une tentation de croire que nous aussi, nous sommes capables de tout. Pourtant, il est crucial de r\u00e9aliser que cette toute-puissance n'est pas absolue, qu'elle a ses propres limites et que les hommes doivent en \u00eatre conscients. Un exemple frappant de cette erreur de jugement peut \u00eatre observ\u00e9 chez le policier \u200bMumbuki, dont l'arrogance et la confiance en sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 manipuler les \u00e9v\u00e9nements le m\u00e8nent vers des cons\u00e9quences inattendues et dangereuses.</p><p>Dans cette histoire, ma\u00eetre Omra yezal explorera les dangers qui guettent ceux qui se laissent aveugler par l'apparente toute-puissance des forces occultes.

Une invitation \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion sur notre nature et sur la place que nous occupons dans un univers o\u00f9 les forces occultes peuvent sembler fascinantes, mais o\u00f9 elles ne sont pas invincibles.</p><p>rendez vous pour le premier \u00e9pisode de umbuki le policier......tr\u00e8s bient\u00f4t</p>",
