Over the next 7 years from 2015-2022 I took over 200 people on 17 different trips to discover how to best solve this problem In 2019 I founded O C N W T R - a local church that began with 3 people in a Jui Jitsui studio on Wednesday Nights in San Clemente CA in May 2019. Since that time we helped start 35 other churches in 6 countries that disciple about 1100 people and have produced 7287 liters of water I have traveled to 42 countries and hold a B.A. in Religious Studies, an M.A. in Counseling &amp; a Doctorate in Public Health Policy.

Board motivation for assessing performance is discussed along with change in the board and its impact on the organization. Each episode concludes with a summary of lessons learned and the elements that make each case a great love story.\n\nIn Season 2, the nine dimensions of board effectiveness assessed in the Board Checkup are explored with nonprofit leaders.  Each dimension assessed is defined theoretically. Next, drawing from the research, common issues that can challenge board effectiveness are discussed along with theories about why they exist, and change boards have implemented in response to them.   \n\nThe podcast will be of interest to board chairs, CEOS, and directors looking for accessible and affordable research-based tools and resources to measure, track, and develop in leadership and governance effectiveness. It will also be of interest to consultants working with boards as well as regulators and funders concerned about board accountability and impact. Finally, it will be of interest to faculty and students of nonprofit leadership looking for case studies that explore the complex nature of governance, the governance context in different cultures and countries, and the range of leadership roles and responsibilities boards and directors play in the organizations they govern.\n",

Together, Ioana and Kat will discuss the implications of the guest scholar\u2019s research, with Ioana focusing on the policy implications, and Kat focusing on the implications for philanthropy \u2013 i.e., private action for public good.",

Each episode highlights one question asked by host, 17-year-old Max Hyman from Chicago, to each of over 30 teens from Israel and/or Palestine in interviews and dissects many of the responses and what they reveal over the successes and failures of the peacebuilding system. Episodes end with conclusions from these discoveries and focus on the importance of listening to teen voices. Teens for Peace in the Middle East, founded in 2020, was built by a team of teens looking to make a difference by creating a network of connected teens for a more peaceful future in Israel and Palestine that values the voices of youth, who are young enough to reverse permanent and harmful stereotypes and opinions. In addition to over 30 interviews, teenspeace.org features educational materials for teens to learn about the conflict from an unbiased perspective, and Teens for Peace in the Middle East hosts panels and discussions. The organization is currently planning a PeaceSummit event and is conducting professional research on the successes and failures of the peacebuilding system.",

GreenTeens is a podcast that interviews teens who are making a difference for the planet and leading the movement towards environmental change. The main goal of GreenTeens is to inspire our listeners to get out and make a change for our Earth from hearing others' stories, so they too can become green teens! I'm your host, Colleen McDermott. I am 16 years old and a part of the Miss America's Teen Program. The MAO is not only the leading scholarship provider for young women. They also give young women the platform to advocate for a cause they are passionate about called their Community Service Initiative. My Community Service Initiative is Planet Youth, advocating for the environment to our youth through education, service, and awareness. I hope to be able to share a little inspiration to every young listener to get out and get green through this podcast. I hope you enjoy and thank you for tuning in!</p>",

JEI provides students, under the guidance of a teacher or advisor, the opportunity to submit and gain feedback on original research and to publish their findings in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Because grade-school students often lack access to formal research institutions, we expect that the work submitted by students may come from classroom-based projects, science fair projects, or other forms of mentor-supervised research.",

        "description": "<p>PURPOSE // To gather those called by their Father to know HIM in order to make HIM known // Malachi 4:5-6 Remnant Church of Denton exists for the purpose of raising up sons and daughters of Christ's Kingdom for this generation and the next. Sons and daughters as expressed in 1 Corinthians 4:15 and 1 John 2 speaks in a familial language. Once we begin to study the bible, we can understand the familial perspective from which it was written. In search of authentic relationships that mirror our studies we reach out to our local church. For many of us, this is where the journey ends as we discover institutionalized church that leaves us wanting. The leadership of Remnant Church desires to witness your potential and help you make it reality. Jesus said that the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. We are not interested in gathering numbers or sustaining you on milk. Instead, we look forward to meeting those who God has ordained to make up our Remnant family; to live and learn mutual devotion together and look forward to the day that the student surpasses the teachers. MISSION // To grow, equip, and mature every saint for the work of THE ministry // Ephesians 4:11-13 \"Each generation will praise your works to the next and proclaim your mighty acts.\" Psalms 145:4 CJB Scriptures such as Psalms 145:4, Deuteronomy 4:9-10, Psalm 78:6, and John15, presume that the believer is living according to the Genesis 1:28 mandate which is: to be fruitful, multiply, fill and subdue the earth. This does not exclude those who cannot or have not had physical children. We passionately believe in growing up in the Faith, from sons and daughters to mothers and fathers, that we may indeed make an impact on our current generation. Even more so that we might leave a strong impression on the next. Acts tells us that although God's promises may be first realized by us in our generation, that by design, it is given to us to impact the next. Teaching us not to live as consumers but rather, to lift up and pour into the next generation. Remnant Church\u2019s greatest hope above all, is that the goodness of God that has been so abundantly poured out on our lives would be evident to all. We desire that our lives would be lived with such a passion and affection for Jesus, that what has been freely given to us would be imparted to those around us, whereby, fulfilling the Genesis 1:28 mandate to multiply His presence in this present generation. VISION // To give fully mature sons and daughters to all nations until the full harvest has come in, the bride has made herself ready, and King Jesus is enthroned in Jerusalem // Micah 4:6-8 Discipleship is a lifestyle not a program. We have found it best to simply: - live a life abandoned to Jesus - allow the Holy Spirit to gather those who desire to do the same - enter into everyday life together as we live and learn how to better re-present King Jesus to a hopeless and dying world. VALUES // To guard Holy Spirit empowerment, Lifestyle Evangelism &amp; Missions, Historical Christian Orthodoxy, and Eternal Family // Matthew 28:16-20 \u200b</p>",

You are listening to Senior Evangelist Ps Martin Duffy, Senior Pastor Ross Roberts, and occasionally from our guest preachers. Ps Martin Duffy is the Senior Evangelist and Founder of Elim Church Global who has an apostolic call to the nations. Elim Church Global was founded in 2006 on the Central Coast, NSW, Australia as a base to support global outreach. We are a non-denominational church community where all are warmly welcomed and where the whole counsel of God is preached in the Power of the Holy Spirit. We are a Church which believes that the Word of God is infallible and is to be obeyed. We believe all the gifts and power of the Holy Spirit is for today. We are a Church that is deeply missional; seeking to go into all of the world with the good message of salvation through Jesus Christ. We desire that all who attend meetings encounter God Himself and leave changed by this encounter. We also deeply desire that people are able to flourish in their gifts within a loving and supportive environment. The prophet Isaiah inspired by the Holy Spirit spoke: Behold, I will do a new thing, Now it shall spring forth; Shall you not know it? I will even make a road in the wilderness And rivers in the desert. The beast of the field will honor Me, The jackals and the ostriches, Because I give waters in the wilderness And rivers in the desert, To give drink to My people, My chosen. This people I have formed for Myself; They shall declare My praise.\u201d \u202d\u202dIsaiah\u202c \u202d43\u202c:\u202d19-21\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c We hope and pray Rivers In The Desert will truly enrich and strengthen your spirit-man.

Some of those uses are obvious: washing dishes, swimming, or watering plants. Others are less obvious: generating energy, building roads, and manufacturing goods that travel far from the water\u2019s source to reach their destination. But even given those many uses\u2014and the many more users who expect clean water on demand\u2014it\u2019s easy to take for granted how critical this one resource is to life.\n\nWhat, exactly, is the value of water? We try to answer this question through a series of engaging conversations with experts in their fields, and, hopefully, inspire a new appreciation of the waters you call home.\n\nTHE COLLECTIVE TAP is a project of the White River Alliance, a 501(c)(3)organization located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We are an alliance of diverse interests and organizations that work together to steward the River and its watershed. It is made possible with generous funding from the Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.\n\nProduced in partnership with Absorb., a boutique music and media label. ",

        "description": "Welkom bij \u2018Het rouwt in jou\u2019, de podcast van vzw het Berrefonds die jou wil helpen, troosten, inspireren en steunen na het verlies van een kind*.\n\nIn eerlijke gesprekken komen alle aspecten van rouw en verdriet aan bod om jou zo inzichten en woorden te geven. Dankzij deze podcast ontdek je hopelijk dat alles wat je voelt normaal is en dat er ruimte moet zijn voor rouw en verdriet en dat je tijd mag vragen en nemen. Zelfs een leven lang.\n\nDeze podcast is er voor ouders, maar ook voor de ruime framily en professionals of zorgverleners rond een overleden kind. Dit immense verdriet bespreekbaar maken, kunnen we vanuit het Berrefonds niet alleen, daar hebben we hulp voor nodig. Want iedereen kent wel iemand die een kind verloor.\n\nDus wie je ook bent en op welke manier je ook geconfronteerd wordt met dit verdriet, we zijn blij dat je luistert en we hopen dat we met deze podcast mee het verschil kunnen maken.\n\nDeze podcast kwam tot stand met de warme steun van een heel aantal mooie mensen. Mira Bertels & Wannes Deneer, ouders van Sam*, componeerden de zachte muziek. Seppe, de nonkel van George* zorgde voor de opname en montage van bijna alle afleveringen. Gunther, de papa van Finn* & Lenne* verzorgde de opname van de aflevering in onze Koestercaravan. Uiteraard ook een warm dankjewel aan iedereen die kwam praten aan onze tafel.\nWe dragen dit alles op aan al de kinderen* die we missen en ons nog elke dag inspireren en moed geven om verder te gaan.  \n\nHeb je na het beluisteren van deze aflevering nood aan een babbel of wil je meer weten over de volledige dienstverlening van het Berrefonds? Surf dan even naar berrefonds.be en ontdek wat we nog allemaal voor jou kunnen doen. Of wat jij voor ons kunt doen.\n\nWant het Berrefonds is voor haar werking bijna volledig afhankelijk van giften. Als je het waardevol vindt wat wij doen voor gezinnen met verdriet, help ons dan met een gift zodat we ook kunnen blijven zorgen voor de ouders van morgen.\n\nWe vinden het zo erg dat het rouwt in jou. \n",

        "description": "<p>\"Thinking out Loud\" is the podcast for the non-profit organization, Love Me As I Am (LMAIA), LMAIA's main focus is neurodivergent children and their parents/caregivers. In this first episode we will be discussing receiving your child's diagnosis, in this case, the diagnosis is level two Autism. We will talk about about what it took to get to this point, the missed milestones, the diagnosis, and life after the diagnosis. We will discuss what the diagnosis meant for the child, as well as the family. Being a parent/caregiver is hard, and there are a variety of emotions involved, listen as we tackle this maze and understand that it's ok not to not feel ok somedays.</p><p>Music courtesy of KJ Sawka at <a href=\"http://KJSAWKA.com\">KJSAWKA.com</a></p>",

Breaking Barriers by AsianVisiON strives to break down the barriers these expectations have built and foster a supportive environment for Asian individuals by raising awareness about the challenges that people of the majority may not need to face.

        "description": "<p>Born a trickle from high in the Rocky Mountains, the Elbow River flows for 120km through mountains and foothills before entering the Bow River in Mohkinstis (Calgary, Alberta). After joining the Bow River system, the waters eventually flow into the Hudson\u2019s Bay as the Nelson River. Over 500,000 people rely on the Elbow River for their drinking water. There are many other ways people and all creatures big and small rely on Elbow waters. The Elbow River is a part of the source waters for 3 provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba). The Lake Winnipeg Basin (a part of the Nelson River) flows across the territories of Treaties 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>This pilot series titled \"Voices from the Elbow\" looks at the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 Calgary, AB and surrounding area flood. ' June 2023 marked the 10th year anniversary of the most recent flood on the Elbow River. Topics we touch on during this pilot podcast: water and climate, water quantity (flood, drought), water management, water quality, restoration, wetlands, nature-based solutions, nature appreciation, and communities that are a part of the Elbow and Bow basins.</p><p>The impact of the flood can still be seen today (for example - constructing engineered berms, constructing Springbank Reservoir, higher insurance rates, and PTSD). We conducted a range of interviews with scientists, The City of Calgary water management and the former ED of the local non-profit watershed planning and advisory council, to learn about actions that have been taken since 2013 to help mitigate flood impacts and make the watershed more resilient (to both flood and drought). This is also an opportunity to explore and share knowledge about the watershed, its ecosystem, its climate and what impact there was from the flood and the river\u2019s natural processes.</p><p>There are three hosts of Voices from the Elbow:</p><p>Jer Bobosky, Jer Bobosky is N\u00eehithaw (Woodland Cree) from mihkw\u00e2kam\u00eewi-s\u00eep\u00eesis (Little Red River Cree Nation). Jer is a Podcast technician with the Elbow River Watershed Project working on the \u201c10-year Flood Anniversary\" episodes as well as the \u201cTsuut'ina Aquatic Habitat Restoration\u201d podcast. She was connected to ERWP from community involvement at UCalgary as an undergraduate student in Political Science, with a primary focus on Indignizing and decolonizing political philosophy.</p><p>Flora Giesbrecht is the Executive Director for the non-profit organization, Elbow River Watershed Partnership (ERWP).</p><p>Tyler Redmond was an Integrated Water Management student from SAIT at the time of the interview. He worked with the ERWP as part of his capstone project.</p><p>The Elbow River Watershed Partnership (ERWP) is a non-profit watershed stewardship organization based out of Calgary Alberta. Our vision - Working together for a healthy Elbow River watershed.</p><p>ERWP mission - is to improve the watershed and bring together communities who live, work or play in the watershed <em>(provides a forum for learning about watershed management and the land-water connection. Using local knowledge and scientific expertise, the ERWP promotes watershed management improvement through collaborative, targeted and cost-effective actions by all who have an interest in the watershed.)</em></p>",

        "description": "<p>The Talkin Story podcast is a new project of Well Organized/Black Lives Matter of Jefferson County. It features local people of the global majority (PGM) who are quietly acting as flashpoints for social and cultural transformation within Port Townsend/East Jefferson county. These are the people who have been steadily working almost under the radar to craft a world in which they exist with sovereignty and creativity. They may or may not be in designated leadership roles, but their very existence is a source of inspiration and a touchstone within the PGM community primarily and the broader community as well.</p><p>The first season of this intergenerational podcast is co-hosted by Oceana Sawyer, Ezra Kikue Cook, and Lorenzo McCleese.</p><p>Oceana is an eldering person of African descent who moves in the liminal spaces of life &amp; death, capture &amp; liberation. They are a poet and a writer with a vision of community of local PGM that has the capacity to navigate the reality of liquid modernity.</p><p>Ezra is an ever changing force for change. As much as they talk, you'll never really understand them. His look is always changing and his list of passions is always expanding. Professionally he is known for working at Centrum for the last three years as both a grip and a videographer/broadcast technician. Ezra has years of experience in theater tech, acting, and media production. They are a writer and director with dreams of putting out original films on the big screen. They believe in the importance of advocacy and integrity- the fight for what is right at the small level. They are particularly involved in activism for Queer and Transgender support systems at the local level. Ezra is the eldest son of James Cook, born in Yokohama Japan, and Mirandy Cook, born in the United States. Working on this podcast has helped him to connect to his Japanese American heritage and BIPOC identity.</p><p>Lorenzo is a recent graduate from Port Townsend High School (PTHS) and a freshman at the University of Washington (UW). He has done work for the BIPOC Family Excursion Program, PTHS BIPOC Student Union, and most recently, been a host on the Talkin\u2019 Story Podcast.</p><p>Being born &amp; raised in Port Townsend, Lorenzo is eager to move out to Seattle and study Environmental Science. He hopes to continue engaging with his passion for equity and diversity in Seattle. Lorenzo is a member of the 7th cohort of UW\u2019s Brotherhood Initiative; a program that provides opportunities for academic growth and leadership for underrepresented men of color.</p>",
