They teach us things, help us understand that always elusive other, remind us of what\u2019s important. Before we built the first great cities, reaped our first harvest, or listened to our first podcast, we were telling stories. Stories about us, the world we lived in, and the gods above. we used them to remember where we come from and to wonder where we might be going.\n\n Twice a month I\u2019ll be here, telling you a story. It might be a myth, a folktale, or something else entirely, but it will always be in my words, with a slant towards accessibility and fun. Come to learn, come to enjoy, come as you are to my table, as we meet heroes, monsters, gods, and everyone in-between, for Breakfast with Gilgamesh.\n",

The point of view characters in my books are the characters from the myths themselves: Odin and Frigg. Vidar. Hodr. Loki. And, because the dude is awesome and has a really tough name to pronounce: Vafthrudnir.</p><p>Everything you\u2019ll hear is based on my interpretation of the two main source materials \u2013 the <em>Poetic Edda</em> and the <em>Prose Edda</em>, along with a stack of books that discuss the myths \u2026 and another stack of academic articles that do the same.</p><p>Kinsmen Die has 92 chapters.
