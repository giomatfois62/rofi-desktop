        "description": "Jessie Wallaker is your off-brand coach and creator of the RCK SLD GYM Method, focused on creating your dream life now, being worthy of it without having done \"enough\", and healing your relationship with food, fitness and success in the process. Here she'll dump her experience and help you move through this change in the Brain Dump Diaries.\nFrom having dreams of working in the NFL as an Athletic Trainer, reaching out to head trainers in the NFL and getting responses, shadowing, working with her high school teams, and getting accepted in the oldest accredited school in the US for it, only to fall away and question every choice from there. Her passion for health and fitness went with it, as that was her main focus for control in her years of overworking, hustling and seeking pride in having no life or balance.\nNow, 5 years into realizing that looking to everyone else for motivation and \"permission\" that she's done enough, has created her own hell to have a \"rags to riches story\" to be worthy of having made it.\nShe'll break down how to create and set boundaries in work, school, business, realtionships, food and fitness. All while focusing on healing your realtionship with health to one of support rather than out-of-control destruction.\nThis movement is a smaller voice in the over-saturated environment of \"sleep when you're dead\" and \"life hacks to get more done\", but it's the one that saved her life. And she can't wait to help you through this hard but worthwhile change.",

After COVID, in an effort to reduce the spread, our doors have been closed to field staff, corporate leadership has been grounded from traveling to our offices and we needed a way to keep everyone motivated, engaged and connected. We have always started our day with a 15 minute morning team call, its primary purpose was to inform the team of any patient needs. After COVID, we needed to rethink how we have always done things and reinvent the utility of the morning call. We emerged with a call that provided motivation, support, encouragement, critical COVID updates, patient need updates, employee and team engagement, and strong leadership to help everyone see their way through this Global Crisis. What we happened upon was magic! For a team that pretty much turned over 75% in the early months of COVID, mainly due to personal circumstances, we needed to form and norm a team virtually.

        "description": "This program is my personal journey to breaking the life cycle you were born into to the life you choose for yourself. I overcame sexual abuse, growing up extremely poor (raised on welfare) with a single mom of 4 kids in a rural small town. I raised my siblings from 8 years old with an alcoholic parent trying to stay sober. I worked since I was eight years old, was on the verge of a nervous break down at 15. I made the heart breaking decision to preserve my sanity. I ended up moving in with a religious family at 15. This came as a bitter-sweet situation. I finally moved out on my very own and started finally my life, my way, my control. This was the beginning to the life I wanted and deserved. I had a \"normal\" life for while finally. Then I lost some key people in my finally amazing life. My whole world took a brutal turn. This came with even more brutal emotion distress. This was the beginning of my event I can only describe as a nervous break down. I tried so hard to be stronger than my body could take but I had met my limits physically and mentally. This is where I learned the hard reality that I can't take everything life throws me. I learned about what a narcissist was and how I had to set boundaries for my own self preservation. \nI want to share what I have had to learn the hard way so hopefully others will know it can be done. I also would love for people to know to set up boundaries sooner than I did. I always took pride in trying to learn life management by others \u201clife lessons\u201d. I thought I was invincible on the crap life can throw me. \u201c I can take it\u201d is my personal mantra I would tell my inner self, I learned the hard way I do have a limit on what my body can physically and mentally take to my disappointment. I guess I am only human. That sucks !!!! But it is my heartbreaking reality\u2026 that I am NOT invincible. \n\nI came from nothing and had every reason and opportunity to be a pregnant young teen with limited life options. I could have easily repeated the childhood cycle that many fall victim to. Instead, I became a survivor and took my life by the balls and said, \u201cListen bitch I\u2019m speaking\u201d.  In a nice way. Lol. We are our life choices no matter our circumstances. I am now happily married to my high school sweetheart, and we have two wonderful boys. My husband and I have been together for 30 years (and still like each other). Trust me, I want to kill him at times, but I think that is the sign of a healthy relationship. If you don\u2019t want to invoke harm (metaphorically) on your spouse here and there, then you don\u2019t care. Then you are just existing together in a house. This channel and podcast is how not to be a victim. Overcome the shit life throws you and shine like a diamond, inside and out. If you want to know how to do this in a positive, constructive, and sassy yet classy way, tune in. I am happy to share what I have learned. ",

I am from Tunisia and I have been working in Europe Universities for the last ten years. Like many of you, I aspire to contribute to the social justice and equality efforts. In this podcast, I will invite scholars, students and activists worldwide to discuss topics such as cultural dominance, decolonial feminism, food sovereignty, Islamophobia, and indigenous knowledge among other topics. If like me, you feel angry when you look at your school curriculum, if you believe that we have a lot to learn from minorities and people in the peripheries, then this podcast is for you!

A channel for real hunts with well over three hundred hunts it has become quite popular also. We thank all of you for the success. Thank You! We have now been asked to do podcasts on many different aspects of hunting, and to share our 25 plus years each of  hunting knowledge to help everyone become a better hunters.

        "description": "My name is Sherri, at age 53 I have learned the first step to maintaining your Badassness is through a healthy mind and body. I am an HR Professional for over 25 years and I own and operate a business for just as long.  I have completed my BS in Organizational Leadership and my MS in Leadership Development from Wright-State University. I have learned through trials and tribulations to maintain a healthy mind and body. Before you can maintain a healthy body, you must be in the correct mindset because they work together to keep you grounded. After years of suffering with arthritis and headaches from an almost fatal car accident, and years of fluctuating weight I wanted to have more control over my being. I began mediating in 2020 and trying to eat healthier, and I became certified in nutrition and personal training.  Now, I am not saying that I have mastered the gut, but I have made significant improvements to my health which is connected to the mind. After suffering for years with arthritis, headaches, and fluctuating weight loss.   Another way to maintaining your brain function or having a healthier brain Is through learning.  You don\u2019t have to wait for permission or for the education fund to be approved by your organization to get those back pocket skills. Back pocket skills are skills you obtain when they are not required for work or skills that are opposite from your 9-5 job. Becoming a mentor is one of the most fulfilling back pocket skills you can obtain. Unfortunately, most people with color lack the knowledge of a professional mentor or even know the definition of one. I did not get one until my early thirties, so I want to share my professional experience with you and help you become the best version of yourself.\nMarriage, cheating, and lying are some of the questions we get on our other forums.  Many questions have been asked of us such as:\n1. Should I forgive my husband for cheating on me and having a baby with a stripper? What will that do to me emotionally?\n2. I married my cheating husband twice, and after our second divorce he told me he never stopped cheating.  This is 12 years our second marriage.\n3. Why do some people call white women Karens? I have seen black women act worse, are they called Shaniquas? \n4. I forgave my husband for cheating and four years later I ended up in the ER with flu like symptoms.  After several hours, the doctor comes out and tells me that I have AIDS.\nWe can all use constructive advice and friends that will come to our rescue when we need emotional support. Let's help each other throughout these tough situations and learn together to maintain our sanity.  Every one of us can use encouragement!\nSo, come on and let's take this journey together and Maintain Our Badassness!",

        "description": "Design is Not Neutral is a podcast built from a thesis project. As a present design master's student at the University of Notre Dame, I began a broader inquiry into the way design as a field was built and the way we now teach design. After doing more research, it became clear - that design in the United States has a diversity problem. The roots of our diversity issue are squarely in how we define and teach Graphic Design. Graphic Design was made for white, cis-gendered, able-bodied men in consumer-driven societies. With this foundation, how we determine what is \u2018good design\u2019 has become extremely exclusionary. Yet, despite increased conversation around equity, design education has yet to dramatically change. The designers and design educators interviewed on Design is Not Neutral have all deeply researched the field of design education in order to improve our field. This podcast will not only provide listeners with resources on how to challenge their own perceptions of what design has been defined by, it will also provide concrete examples of how this work is being done in classrooms. I hope you enjoy each conversation as much as I did and if you liked Design is Not Neutral please check us out on Instagram.",

The creators of the 2152 Project, Mike Hassler (Utah) and Jason Van Nus (Georgia), live 2,152 miles apart, where the name for the 2152 Project emerged. They are both considered thought-leaders in the Work-Based Learning space.\n\nThe genesis for their vision of the 2152 project began when Jason met Mike at a conference. During introductions, a dialogue ensued where each realized that they were being contacted by states, schools, WBL professionals, and businesses across the country to address issues emerging within the Work-Based Learning community. As a result of this dialogue, The 2152 Project emerged to take these private, siloed conversations into the public forum, hoping to create more robust WBL Programs that better serve our students, communities, and industries.\n",

I aim to provide support, guidance, and advice on topics I know about and content I believe you can benefit from. As an educator, mother, and school leader I know how time-consuming our day-to-day responsibilities can be so I created this podcast with that in mind. Most episodes are 25 minutes or less, allowing you to listen on your way to work, while you take a shower, or while you work out. Additionally, my goal for The Coffee Stained: EDU Podcast is for listeners to take something away from each episode. Let's embrace that we are lifelong learners!

Thank You!</strong></p><p>Everything has a story, doesn't it? And every story has a story behind it, a context, which often turns out to be a cluster of stories. It can even be said that every story is connected to a web of stories that form circumstance. Backstory defined is a story that tells what led up to the main story or plot, especially for a character or situation. It can also be a narrative providing a history or background context for a literary, cinematic, or dramatic work.</p><p>Writers of all stripes find themselves ensconced in backstory. Creating backstory on the page, stage, and screen is the stuff fulfilling, engrossing, and satisfying works are made of. Are you inspired to create on the page and want to know more about the nuts and bolts of structuring from a backstory perspective? Do you want a deeper dive into the fascinating world of backstory? You've come to the right place! Tune in weekly starting April 30th and join us every Sunday evening at 8:00 p.m. EST in our informative exploration into the incredible world of backstory.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Motherhood is a beautiful and complex journey that has been celebrated and explored throughout the ages. It is a journey that is unique to each woman who embarks on it, yet it is also a shared experience that connects mothers across the world. Being a mother is a role that comes with great responsibility, sacrifice, and love. The moment a woman becomes a mother, her life changes forever. She is no longer just responsible for herself, but also for the life of her child. The bond between a mother</p><p>and her child is one of the strongest and most enduring relationships in the world. It is a connection that begins before birth and lasts a lifetime. A mother is the first person a child looks to for comfort, safety, and guidance. Motherhood is a journey that is filled with many challenges. From sleepless nights to the terrible twos, raising a child can be a rollercoaster of emotions. Mothers often have to juggle multiple roles, including being a caregiver, teacher, nurse, and friend. They have</p><p>to be patient, understanding, and compassionate, even when they are exhausted and frustrated. Despite the challenges, motherhood is also a journey that is filled with joy and love. The first smile, the first word, and the first steps are all milestones that fill a mother's heart with pride and happiness. Mothers have the opportunity to watch their children grow and develop into unique individuals with their own personalities and dreams. Motherhood is also a journey that is marked by sacrifice.</p><p>Mothers often put their own needs and desires aside to prioritize the needs of their children. They give up their time, energy, and resources to ensure that their children have everything they need to thrive. This selflessness is a testament to the depth of a mother's love. In conclusion, motherhood is a journey that is both beautiful and complex. It is a journey that is unique to each woman who embarks on it, yet it is also a shared experience that connects mothers across the world. Being a mother</p><p>is a role that comes with great responsibility, sacrifice, and love. It is a journey that is filled with challenges, but also with joy and love.</p>",

        "description": "<p>When it comes to using technology in classroom, it is vital for every educator to be aware of the students' privacy as it is important to keep the students and we as teachers safe from cybercrime. There are many advantages when it comes to using digital technology in classrooms and also many disadvantages related to it. A few advantages are: students get very excited and become very active, students become more innovative and students become more knowledgeable which help them to prepare themselves for the future. However, there are also disadvantages associated to it for example, cyber bullying which is a common case, students become anti social even being in classrooms and the plagiarism is a common issue. Hence, it is vital to create a safe environment for both teachers and students when it comes to using digital technologies in classrooms. Moreover, every student must be treated fairly and equally regardless to their ethnicity. Everyone should be given adequate access to using technological tools. Teachers must be well trained to be able to cater for a holistic approach to teaching. </p><p>Hobbs, Renee. <em>Create to Learn : Introduction to Digital Literacy</em>, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated, 2017.<em> ProQuest Ebook Central</em>, <a href=\"https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/qmu/detail.action?docID=7104295\">https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/qmu/detail.action?docID=7104295</a>.</p><p> </p><p>BBC Scotland Selkirk, David Knox, (2022) <em>Apple targets Scottish Borders for teaching revolution. </em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63545718\">https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63545718</a>.

        "description": "<p>This book was recommended by Robert T. Kiyosaki in <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>. After reading both books, I understand that Kiyosaki has taken lots of insights from Clason. And I understand why, because this book is filled with wisdom!</p><p>At whatever stage you\u2019re at in your life right now, this is a must read, because one way or the other, it\u2019s going to help you improve the way you are living your life. We all have ambitions in life and desires we want to see realized. To be able to fulfill those ambitions and desires, we need to be successful with money. And this book brings the exact wisdom on how to do so. The first step is to always set aside a part of your earnings. However big or small it is, before paying anyone else, take at least 10% and keep it for yourself. When you have accumulated your savings, make sure what you have saved starts to earn. When taking advice on what to invest in, only take counsel from experienced people. And while doing so, don\u2019t forget to enjoy life while you\u2019re here. Live according to your income and don\u2019t be afraid to spend your money. Life is rich with things worthwhile and enjoyable. But don\u2019t confuse the necessary expenses with your desires. Budget for those necessary expenses and keep working within your budget, adjusting it when required.</p><p>Look for opportunities so your savings can be multiplied. Consult with professionals to guarantee safe investments. Be prepared to protect your family and be prepared for your retirement.</p><p>Respect yourself by cultivating your own powers, to study, to become wiser, and to become more skillful. As Clason puts it, \u201cWhere the determination is, the way can be found.\u201d</p>",
