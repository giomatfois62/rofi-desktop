Many of the episodes are light-hearted as they are shared from a real-life perspective and not necessarily from a teaching perspective, however, our hope is that everyone who listens will learn something new and be encouraged in their own spiritual journey.\nFlourish Through the Word is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and donations are tax deductible as allowed by law.

We want to help you see the beauty in your struggle, and remind you that God's love for you surpasses any challenges. \n\nThis podcast won't get too theological, but it will compel you to try and see your life through God's eyes.

Walker walked out of his dorm room in the middle of a blizzard with only two blank books, and lived the next 44 days without any money or ID, going where the wind blew. Because of a single discovery, he stopped everything to walk out into the world, throwing wide open all of his defenses, and making himself completely vulnerable to anyone he met. And what was the discovery which caused this? The massive hidden secret behind what laughter is and why we find something funny. \n<p><p>\nHave you ever tried to explain why somethings are funny and somethings aren't? Tune in to W. S. Walker's The Laughing Matters, the ground-breaking book, read chapter by chapter by the author (and then all manner of advice, musings, and wisdoms after Season 1), and hang on as he sends you reeling through some of the most incredible discoveries on human behavior, why we don't feel right so much of the time, and the core blueprint for the universal design of happiness; things hidden in plain sight your entire life and answers that you never would have expected. The moment you hear them, you will understand that you've always known them.<p>The true motivations behind why we laugh will shock you to your core.<p>\n<p><p><i><b>A fair bit of warning: once you hear some of the hidden truths, you cannot unhear them. They are night and day obvious once you know which angle to see them from. </b></i><p><p>\n\nThis is an advanced edition. The book has not been publicly released yet. If you want a much better understanding of who you are, why you don't feel important, where so much of your internal conflict (at a base-level) comes from, come on in and have a listen. <p><p>\n\nI've got some good news, and some bad news for you.\n<p><p>\nyoutube.com/couldhelp<p>\nwww.thelaughingmatters.com<p>\nfacebook.com/icouldhelp<p>\nwillhelpmail@gmail.com\n\n",

        "description": "Integrating the twin Great Commission tasks of language learning and gospel communication, Language 180 gets to the heart of gospel fluency across cultures. \n\nLanguage 180 is a reorientation, a complete pivot in perspective: We're reminded that language learning is something we don\u2019t have to do before we share the gospel, rather something we get to do while we share the gospel.\n\nLanguage 180 is a reminder to persevere when we're tempted to plateau. Language 180 also refers to the minutes we spend every day in ongoing learning toward a sustained lifestyle of evangelism and discipleship in the language. In other words, through Language 180 we practice learning the language to communicate the gospel 3 hours per day, 60 minutes in each of three activities - personal preparation (1st hour), deliberate practice (2nd hour), and fluent proclamation (3rd hour) - for a total of 180 minutes each day. Want to learn more? Start with the first episode, \"What is Language 180?\"\n\nIn the Language 180 podcast, we explore core concepts that sync with articles and resources found on the language180.com website where we learn to: 1) Understand the basics of gospel fluency across cultures 2) Align our perspective with God\u2019s perspective on gospel fluency 3) Evangelize our lost neighbors as we learn their language 4) Comprehend and tell simple familiar gospel stories in our new language 5) Engage our neighbors through the limitless radius of the gospel in all life encounters 6) Learn to listen and respond as an integral part of the fluency needed to reach neighbors with the gospel 7) Know what it means to intelligently learn a language 8) Invest in life-long language learning 9) Practice Language 180 for fruitful ongoing learning and in-language ministry 10) Converse the gospel in our new language 11) Share our testimony; pray for our neighbors, and 12) Identify as Kingdom pilgrims, with an unwavering assurance in our destination and an insatiable desire to invite others to join us from the \u201cnations of every language\u201d (Zechariah 8:23).

We see the world through the lens of Jesus which results in spiritual warfare becoming a chosen lifestyle vs the commonly seen apathetic and lethargic country club church going Christian.\n\nWhat does that mean to you and I?  To abandon the comfort of living with our eyes closed - to help the church wake up, to see the enemies work all around us for what it is and to remain vigilant, looking for opportunities to engage the enemy in prayer.\n\nThere's only one way to stir the church from comfort and lethargy - change your perspective, change your footing on the full measure of the word, pray for wisdom and discernment and ask the Lord to show you how you're called righteous indignation and Holy Spirit inspired anger.  \n\nEphesian armor was meant for everyone which means all of us are called to battle - but some of us are called to war.  Journey with us as we discuss the ways we choose to see and engage in Spiritual Warfare, and listen along as we challenge each other and discuss how to change our collective Christian footing before revival on the way up becomes revival on the way down.\n\nWe love the church and we want to see it become the Biblical foundation this country was founded on - but we also know at some point the cultural church will vilify and hunt down Holy Spirit filled Christ followers as they work to fulfill the Anti-Christ's agenda and purpose.\n\nThis isn't your normal, average watered down Christian podcast - but we encourage you to engage and test everything we say against the Holy Spirit, and to find your place as a watchman on the walls as Christ prepares us for His return.\n\nGod Bless and Godspeed",

I found myself alone in a closed country, with nothing familiar around me. Because of the extreme circumstances, Jesus became more real to me than ever before, and because there was no one else to rely on, I began to hear His voice loud and so clear. Thus we spent our time in conversation. This is a story that's never fully been told, its about how when everything was stripped away and I had nothing left but Jesus to hold on to, how He became more real to me than ever. It was my adventure with Holy Spirit. Raw, real yet true. I came back with new eyes, and a completely fresh perspective. All that mattered was Him. it was a time of growth and renewal. And the ministry there was something else. Everything that happened had a powerful effect on me, and one that would last a life time. ",

The church is the mystical body (believers) of Jesus Christ and it has one mission and that is to \"Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature\" [Mark 16:15 KJV]. The mission isn't to expand a brand or an enterprise and call it a church. The mission is, as a believer, to tell everyone and everything about the good news concerning the sacrifice that Jesus made (the message), and to everyone that believes this message they shall be saved; and to everyone that does not believe this message shall be damned [Mark 16:16 KJV, emphasis added]. Ekklesia United is focused on carrying out the mission of delivering this message to everyone and everything through digital mediums, ecumenical unification, and live events. There is no need to build another church. The church was empowered, built, and sent back in Acts 2. Today, we are tasked with continuing in the exact same work that started then. Therefore, Ekklesia United is not another church, but rather an assembly of believers united in the mission of preaching/delivering the message, the gospel of Jesus Christ, to everyone and everything so they will be saved.</p><p>Connect with Anthony Richardson, the founder and creator of Ekklesia United, on all social platforms @gr8rimpact or email at <a href=\"mailto:questions@ekklesiaunited.com\">questions@ekklesiaunited.com</a>.

Psalm 19:7: declares that the \u201ctestimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple\u201d. But the simple cannot be made wise by something they are unable to understand. Surely, the Word of God does demand the need for interpretation, explanation, and exposition of the scripture by diligent Bible Teachers.

There are many things in life to prepare for: college, gameday, a career, marriage, having a family, owning a home, retirement. Preparing for these endeavors is part of life\u2019s journey; personally, I have worked to prepare myself for many of them. But even more, I am in the process of preparing myself for an even greater event than getting married or owning my own home, as great as these things are. I am preparing to meet the King who is coming back someday for His people. \n\nDear Listener, my name is Josiah Moldenhauer, and the purpose of this podcast is to help you prepare as well, prepare to meet this King of the Ages who is coming soon for those who believe in Him and follow Him. Who is this King? He is also known as the King of Glory. He is the Chosen One who came to redeem us back to God from our sin and shame that we may know Him as Father and save us from Hell that we might know Heaven as home. \n\nJesus Himself tells us at the end of the book of Revelation: \u201cBehold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. \u2018I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.\u2019\u201d (Revelation 22:12-16, NIV 1984). \n\nDear Listening Friend, have you washed your sin-stained robes in the blood of the Lamb? I\u2019m so glad I have! He has forgiven and cleansed me of my sins. If you have never met the Savior, He stands at the door of your heart and knocks. Open the door to Him while there is still time; you do not want to be left outside in the dark. Hell is as terrible and real as Heaven is glorious. Jesus said, \u201cThe thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10, ESV). Jesus offers true spiritual life with God now and for eternity. He is the only one who gives living water that quenches our thirsty souls. \n\n \u201cThe Spirit [of God] and the bride say, \u201cCome!\u201d And let him who hears say, \u201cCome!\u201d Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life (Rev. 22:17, NIV). \n\nDear friend, join me on a journey of knowing and following this Jesus together as we prepare for His glorious coming! As we learn to believe in Him, to love Him with our lives, and to long for His return. Our King is coming back soon! He told us, \u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\u201d (Matt. 24:42, NIV).\n\nGrace and Peace to you in Jesus Christ the Lord. \n",

        "description": "Christian... A title synonymous with son's of God. But many that carry the title more than lack in their abilities to reflect the attributes given of God. Unfortunately Christianity as a whole has failed to be evidence of the Glory of God among men, but this was the first thing that Christ did in all His works. So how could we possibly declare the deity of the word made flesh and fail to reflect all that he made possible in us? \n\n   From one end of God's word to the other, we were warned of the short comings that would befall much of the body of Christ. This is the venue designed to give revelation of the elements that have effectually hindered us from walking as Son's of the most high. The question is what will you do once you know the truth? \n   In the call of a modern day Apostle it is imperative that my actions and intent clearly manifest honor of all that God is. Moreover I declare nothing of myself except that I must be subject to the directives of His Holy Spirit.  For even as in times past, a true Apostle must glorify God in all of his endeavors. The mandate to point the hearts of man back to Father God is the sole purpose of my ministry efforts. A messenger need not prove a thing, God will reveal Himself. That is to all who dare to truly seek Him.\n   Change isn't a hard thing at all. the problem is accepting that there is a need for change. If you can muster the revelation of your own hidden motives, I can guarantee that the teachings to be found here will be a great assistance in finding the launch pad for change in your own life.\n",

        "description": "The \"Touch of the Master's Hand\" is a Christian poem written in 1921 by Myra Brooks Welch. It is depicted in the painting by Ken Brooks used in our Podcast cover art. It tells of an old, battered violin that is about to be sold as the last item in an auction. The highest bid was $3. When suddenly a man in the back of the auction hall walked to the front of the building, took the violin from the auctioneer, wiped off the dust, tuned it and began to play. As he played, the patrons could hardly believe that such a melody could come from such a battered instrument. The violinist finished playing, handed the instrument back to the auctioneer, and walked back to his seat. Amazed and astonished the auctioneer softly said, \"Now how much am I bid for this violin?\" Instead of $3, the violin was sold for $3,000. The crowd asked, \"What was it that suddenly brought value to such a battered instrument?\" The auctioneer replied, \"It was the touch of the master's hand!\" The poem goes on to draw the analogy between the violin and a person whose life has been battered and torn by sin. Just as the master violinist brought value to the old violin, Jesus, our Creator, the Master of the universe and lover of our soul, will make our lives valuable, no matter how battered we may be!\n\nBill Crockett has a masters degree in Biblical Exposition and has served as an evangelist, pastor, counsellor and Bible Conference speaker across the US and in many countries. Bill also worked in corporate sales and sales management for almost 25 years. Having experienced divorce, the loss of a job, death of an immediate family member and depression to the point of suicide, he understands the ups and downs of life. At one point feeling as if God did not love or care about him, he discovered the true meaning of a personal walk with God and found renewed purpose and value as God touched his life once again!\n\n\"Touch of the Master's Hand\" is a podcast sharing practical truths from the Bible that will help us realize our value and live productive and fulfilled lives as we are touched by the truth of God's Word.",

The truth is - we make no deposits, and we need no loans. We have been redeemed by Him. He paid the price and the ransom for our souls\u2014all of it, in full, for all of us\u2014with His blood. Living the gospel of Jesus Christ is not about earning our salvation, a concept that only leads to frustration and failure. Living the gospel of Jesus Christ is about choosing daily to qualify for His gift that He freely offers us, by relying wholly on Him. The gospel is a system of redemption. The gospel is not a system to promote the assimilation of virtuous habits and the accumulation of good deeds\u2014all people can achieve worthy goals and live good lives. In Redeemed Through His Blood, we learn how others have experienced redemption and we discuss how each of us may access the power of Christ and His Atonement, which will bring His joy and His peace into our lives.</p>",

We have an unwanted and involuntary attraction to children, but we have decided to obey Christ and not act according to those feelings. In no way do we condone sexual involvement with children. It is inherently harmful and is not what God wants for our sexuality.\n\nWe are part of the family of God, and we know that he loves us. God isn't stumped by pedophilia. He's able to lead us to the victory Jesus won on the cross. He can bless us, and make our lives wonderful stories. Our desire is to share the Gospel with others who experience pedophilia, and the hope of freedom and new life that Jesus offers.\n",

Join us as we share our heart, principles from God's Word, and tools and ideas to help you build a stronger marriage.

The podcast is an audio messaging feed that promotes the bible-based image of the Liberal Jesus, full stop!",

War, bloodshed, strife, famine, disease, anxiety, and numberless other evils are continually gathering heavy shadows of darkness upon this planet. It is often the case that trouble is greater in anticipation than in reality; but this is not true of the crisis before us.\n\nThe whole system of religious principles and doctrines, which should form the foundation and framework of social life, seems to be a tottering mass, ready to fall to ruin. The press publishes the revolting details of vice, thus initiating others into the practice of fraud, robbery, and murder; and Satan exults in the success of his hellish schemes.\n\nThe infatuation of vice, the wanton taking of life, the terrible increase of intemperance and iniquity of every order and degree, should arouse all who fear God, to inquire what can be done to stay the tide of evil.\n\nThe messages and program content streamed through Voice in the Wilderness Internet Radio are designed to help prepare a people for this coming crisis. To every soul will come the searching test: Shall I obey God rather than men?",

But God has grown it into so much more! So, a CovLady is any woman walking in covenant with Jesus Christ!</p><p>What do we do:</p><p>It's simple. This group was birthed with the desire to daily encourage our sisters in the Lord. It's our desire to empower you through the Holy Spirit, to take up your armor, get on the offense and fight through whatever the enemy may be throwing at you.</p><p>What to expect:</p><p>We have several women on our Fight Team that take turns \"going live\" 5 days a week (M-F.)

Add in some teen drama and social media and all of that living for the glory of God can get kind of difficult and may cause someone to have some pretty hard to answer questions. Like does pineapple really belong on pizza, or how can I explain my faith to a friend who needs Jesus? \nWell that\u2019s what this podcast is all about. It\u2019s about encouraging you in your daily walk with the lord and hopefully having some fun along the way.

        "description": "Do You Know The Holy Spirit\n\nBe honest here, how many of you can define what is the Holy Spirit? Not many I presume, for I too was one who knew nothing of the Holy Spirit except for some bits and pieces of information I had retained from the masses I had attended. But it was after one blissful encounter that piqued my interest in discovering more about this Holy Specter. What exactly is it? how do we define it? and what is its role in Christianity?\n\nAlso called the Holy Ghost or Paraclete, it is the third constitute of Christianity. The other two are the father, which is God almighty, and then the son, which is our lord and savior, Jesus Christ. So how can we make Holy Spirit more tangible for our understanding? Think of it as the power of God in action. It\u2019s his active force that gets the will of God done. Yes, it is indeed an invisible force, or rather, a power that is unperceivable by humans. But the effects it produces are very visible and tangible as well. \n\nThe Holy Spirit is not a person; it is referred to as many things across the Bible but a person. You will find words like Breath, Wind, An animating force in living creatures, Hand, and even Fingers. It is also referred to as faith and knowledge. There are numerous mentioning of the Holy Spirit in the Acts of the Apostles, in which there are numerous acts associated with it such as Prophecies/Prophesizing, Healing, Glossolalia, and Exorcism. In biblical art, it is represented as a dove.\n\nHow do we know Holy Spirit does not refer to a person? Well, when Christian martyr Stephen received a miraculous heavenly vision, he only saw people; this signifies Holy Spirit is not a person. As stated in Bible,\n\n\u201cHe, being full of the holy spirit, gazed into heaven and caught sight of God\u2019s glory and of Jesus standing at God\u2019s right hand.\u201d (Acts 7:55)\n\nHere, the Holy Spirit is defined as the power of God in action that enabled Stephen to see the holy vision of God and Jesus by his side. One very common misconception is that Holy Spirit is secondary to Father and Son, which absolutely not true; the true believer must admit the Holy Spirit as equal in substance to the Father and Son, for they all exist in harmony with each other. As such, the eastern and western churches now view the Holy Spirit as a bond between the Father and Son, a mutual charity. Which implies the two are absolutely united in the Spirit. \n\nFor us, Holy Spirit is a helper. It is the embodiment of God\u2019s help that reaches us and fills us with divine bliss at the time when we need it the most. It sanctifies us and rids us of our sins, making us pure and more like Christ. It is because of the Holy Spirit that we get close to God and are directed towards the will of our holy father. \n",

We see a church that turns careers into callings, and conversations into moments where you sense the Holy Spirit. We see a church that seeks to see Jesus and allows the Creator to create with His most prized possession; us. \n\nYou're invited to the journey, where we seek first the Kingdom and righteousness, and trust that He can add all things in His time.

Matthew 18:20 says \"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, I am there among them.\" I want to grow with you as we go through the Bible and see what stands out to us.\n\nAs a quick disclaimer, I am not a Pastor or preacher and besides teaching bass guitar I have never been employed by any Religious establishment. I am just someone who has a relationship with Christ and would love to grow together in faith, knowledge, and community along the way.\n\nIn this series, I want to start by going through the book of wisdom, also known as Proverbs. The great thing about Proverbs is that there are 31 chapters which means that there is a 'Proverb of the Day' no matter which month we are in. My goal for the next year is to go through the Proverb of the day every day. After a Month, I would like to explore a different translation with you and see if anything new stands out.\n\nWith that being said, lets open our hearts and minds and get into the reading!",

We may charge into Monday with a sense of Godly purpose, but often our strength and determination tend to buckle under the weight of the world and daily stress. How can we deal with the pressures of work, school, family, relationships, society, and even self, when Sunday only comes once every seven days?

        "description": "<p>Questions? Comments? Email us at <a href=\"mailto:podcast@mvcc6mile.org\">podcast@mvcc6mile.org</a> </p><p>Mountain View Church of Christ (Christian) is located in a rural community 5 miles south of Maryville, Tennessee near the foothills of the Smoky Mountains. We learn about the Word by studying the Bible. The ministry of MVCC is to spread God's word through example, love and prayer. We believe that each person can share in this ministry by giving of their unique gifts to others. We welcome guests to join us in worship and song each week. The first Mountain View Church of Christ (Christian) building was completed in 1906 and the church was formally organized in October, 1907. From the beginning, faithfulness to the preaching and teaching \"the whole counsel of God\" was very important. During the early years most of the preachers were students who came from Johnson Bible College in Knoxville on the weekends to teach and to preach. Around 1930 James Spencer Holland was hired as the first continuous minister of the church while still a student at the college. He served as the minister for 23 years. The present building was built in 1955 on the former Christy Hill School property. Mountain View Church of Christ 3102 6 Mile Rd Maryville, TN 37803</p>",

The second you step into our venue, you'll be greeted by our Experience team. They'll help you find a seat or help you find anyone you're meeting. We typically do 8 to 9 modern worship songs with a full production. We have a Spotify playlist too in case you want to familiarize yourself with some of the songs! We also spend about 30 minutes in the Word of God. \n\nThe River is not meant to replace church. We believe you should get rooted in a strong Sunday community. If you don't have a home church, let us know! We'll get you connected. \n\nJoin us any Tuesday night at 7:30pm. There's a seat for you. And of course, things will get loud! ",

I believe that all women have the desire to be beautiful, both inside and out. Unfortunately, we also have insecurities, whether big or small, that often keep us from finding our beautiful. Most often, these insecurities are simply the lies about ourselves that we believe, or have been told, rather than believing who and <em>whose</em> we are. In this podcast, I will be encouraging women, no matter what season of life they are walking through, that even though life is crazy, busy, and often tangled, they are not alone. I will be providing gentle reminders and ways to be a better \"you\", not only for yourself, but for those who you do everyday life with! I will also be diving into topics on intimacy in marriage and ways to spice things up a little!</p><p>I am Michele Blumentritt, and I am your host. I am looking forward to walking through life's journey with you and sharing my experiences that have brought me to this point.<strong> </strong>I am the youngest of three girls. I have been married for 24 years to man who loves the Lord and leads our family with strength and dedication. I have 3 beautiful children, a son and two beautiful daughters. My passion and excitement to share with other women how to find their beautiful are what inspired this podcast. Life is full of twists and turns, let's navigate through them together!</p>",

This podcast helps to illuminate what it means to be intimate with others and what it teaches people about them. It will make you want to strive for a kinder, more fun relationship with others.

There are tools to use with an emphasis on building, repairing, and restoring relationships with individuals and families in a safe community environment that will stand in a world that's falling apart. Gil and Ren\u00e9e are originally from Detroit, Michigan. Their relationship started with Ren\u00e9e rolling the pencil off her desk and Gil picking it up. They never knew such a small act would create a 37-year legacy of love. Gil and Ren\u00e9e were only 21 when they happily committed to until death do us part. Gil retired from the Air Force, and Ren\u00e9e is a former salon owner who has been an entrepreneur and now an author for over 30 years. They have lived in over 13 cities throughout the United States and Germany. They are proud parents to an amazing and talented daughter, Aharon (pronounced like Sharon, except with an A). After a family tragedy, they also adopted Ren\u00e9e's little sisters (Carmen and Monique).This couple has helped many other couples establish a new habit of love to strengthen their marriage relationship through their tested relationship tools and principles and as marriage facilitators through the Prepare and Enrich Marriage program. Rich Relationship with Gil &amp; Ren\u00e8e podcast is back and ready to move forward and deeper into our relationship strengths and growth areas. Let's get empty of the pain from our past, unforgiveness, resentment, shame, and uncommunicated expectations.Our mission is to empower singles and couples to experience greater intimacy and fulfillment in their relationship with God, themselves, food, and money. This year our podcast will feature individuals and small business owners regarding their impact in these four areas. Gil and Ren\u00e8e are looking forward to serving you and your relationships.

In this podcast, Zach and Jaylin will be discussing what it means to be a follower of Christ and how we can balance our faith with the demands of everyday life.

Each week, we'll be sharing our personal experiences and insights, as well as having in-depth conversations with guests who have a passion for living out their faith in their own unique ways. Whether you're a seasoned believer or just starting on your faith journey, we believe you'll find something valuable in our conversations.

        "description": "<p>After having sought the truth his whole life, Vatman (Winston) fell for the many lies of the world falling into atheism and a life of sin. While having many scary experiences with the occult and demonic attacks, he finally realized that God was true, but his question was what religion's God was true? Having been baptized in the Catholic Church, but experiencing a traumatizing uncatholic childhood, he was left feeling like in no way was the Catholic Church the real Church of God. Having avoided the True Church and trying out many spiritual practices, God finally revealed His power and truth to Vatman (Winston). With the experience and research he could no longer doubt the Catholic Church.</p><p>After having been in love with the fantasy stories that came off the comic book pages and superhero movies, Cardinal (Sebastian) always wished that these stories were true or that superpowers were real. Funny enough he found out that they were true. After being caught by God in a time when he was finally willing to submit to him and attempt to give up sin, it was revealed to him how truly marvelous God is and how much He is a superhero and one that is real. After coming back to the Catholic church he met even more superheroes with the Saints. It was clear how much God's Saints are almost like sidekicks with real life superpowers being given from the real superhero himself Jesus.</p><p>Together The Catholic Dynamic Duo Podcast hope to provide a fun open space for all believers and non-believers hoping to be a great representation of Christ and not coming off as people trying to brainwash. Hopefully as a believer or not you can find enjoyment in our conversations of how much the true story of the Catholic faith influences fan favorite fictional storytelling, showing how marvelous and super heroic the Catholic faith truly is. Being the greatest Catholic detective duo, thanks to the Holy Spirit, we're able to see God's creativity in every nerdy work of fiction.</p><p>Holy Catholic Church Vatman !</p>",

After years of studying, I've found the Father will speak to you through His Word and tell you exactly what He means.</p><p>We will dispel myths, misquotes, mistruths, and misunderstandings of what Scripture says and what it means. We believe that there can be no proper application (how to live the Word) without correct observation (what the text says) and accurate interpretation (what the text means).</p><p>We will tackle portions of Scripture that are frequently misquoted and taken out of context. We will look at many untruths created based on denominational doctrines and beliefs that may not align with God's Word, and we will discuss how personal agendas can cloud how we interpret Scripture and apply it.</p><p>What You Can Expect:</p><p>1. You can expect Biblical truths.</p><p>2. You can expect to hear things you may have believed or been taught differently.</p><p>3. You can expect humor and laughter</p><p>If you're ready to understand the Bible better, what it says, what it means, and how to apply it to your life, I invite you to subscribe for free to the Did God Say That podcast.</p>",

Each week Amanda Held Opelt (author of the book <em>Holy Unhappiness: God, Goodness, and the Myth of the Blessed Life</em>) will interview writers, pastors, artists, and friends about the myths we believe about \"the good life.\"  Together, we'll reimagine what blessing can look like when we are willing to look beyond our culture's definitions of happiness and success.  Here we make space for grief, lament, weariness, and restlessness, trusting that even our unhappiness has something to teach us about ourselves, about God, and about the world around us.</p>",

        "description": "<p>America. The \"land of the free,\" the \"home of the brave.\" We're all quite familiar with the words of Francis Scott Key's song, <em>The Star Spangled Banner</em>. But what is freedom anyway? What is the real meaning behind the word Liberty? Do we really know, or is it just a feel-good byword in our day; denoting freedom is something whatever one believes is appropriate for them. The truest meaning, the one America's Founding Fathers understood and conceived of for this great Republic, has now been relegated to the past I fear, lost in the shuffle of a progressive, perplexing, and troubled world which knows not the truth of our founding, neither the Almighty God who instituted the ideals of Liberty under God. Come along with me on an amazing journey as we navigate the waters of the past, looking into America's astonishing history, unrevised, unadulterated, and revealed without apology. We will find the truth together, and those who recall, they shall remember, and they who do not know, then shall they know. \"If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?\" (Psalms 11:3, <em>KJV</em>) I shall be drawing from Holy Scriptures, and from my book throughout. The book is <em>Americans We Were</em>. I am Henry Thomas Weber. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Americans-Were-Henry-Thomas-Weber/dp/B0C1JK6NSZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=HWU65AS8MUW2&amp;keywords=americans+we+were+henry+thomas+weber&amp;qid=1687145591&amp;sprefix=americans+we%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-1\">Americans We Were: Weber, Henry Thomas</a></p>",

We pray for God to use this time in our lives to draw us &amp; you closer to Him &amp; to the ultimate purpose He has for us. We will pray during each podcast for God's will &amp; blessing over this situation &amp; give a scripture related to the topics discussed. This journey isn't easy, but knowing you aren't alone, and having an outlet to share and talk about it is a step towards healing. Often times, we suffer in silence and don't know how to talk about it. We also hope that this will bring more awareness to the issue and classification of \"infertility\" and provide more discussions and funding to work towards a better future for those of us in the \"20%.\"</p><p>To watch our podcasts on video, find us @hopeaheadjourney on YouTube </p>",

Before a move is made or decision finalized, God wants us to consult with Him, invite Him, seeks His all knowing Wisdom. He wants us to use the Holy Spirit which is the part of the trinity that was left here on Earth to strengthen, encourage and assist us. God has had us on a journey that we can now say we see fruit from. Listen and walk with us as we embark on uncovering The Fruit of It all: a closer, more intimate relationship with God and a transformation only HE can take credit for. Welcome to the Fruit of It All Ministries. We pray that you\u2019re bearing the fruit from all the stormy, treacherous weather that life has made you endure.

Jesus Christ is the eternal Son of God and completely human and completely God. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine, and is the promised Comforter and Helper to those who follow Jesus. By trusting in Jesus, we are saved from the curse and penalty of sin and can enjoy an abundant and eternal life that begins when we first place our faith in Christ. The Church is a local community of baptized believers unified in Christ. Its purpose is to connect people to God and to connect people to one another by teaching the truth of Christ and taking the Gospel to the world.</p>",

Yes, there are many crucial topics for us to ponder and engage, such as evangelism, sanctification, outreach, and discipleship. However, there are often situations in which less important side issues sneak up from behind and bite the more important ones. Although the supernatural is just one component among many others in a biblical worldview, it's becoming increasingly evident that unbiblical paranormal beliefs are significantly altering the worldviews of our society and of many Bible-believing Christians. The pop-culture paranormal makes people question what they've believed to be true, which ultimately leads many to question the integrity of God's Word. Worldview matters, and when worldviews change, there will be tangible consequences to evangelism, discipleship, and faith in general. \"God and the Paranormal\" takes an in-depth look at what \"experiencers\" claim and how the phenomena interact with scriptural truth.</p><p>See YouTube versions for pic, notes, charts,,,</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://ThinkingAboutTheBible.com\">ThinkingAboutTheBible.com</a></p><p>Email: godandtheparanormal@gmail.com</p>",

Longsuffering is what the Word of God calls it. The voice I will give will come with truth, hurts, pains, vulnerability, beginnings, endings, unforgiveness that God has brought me through over to forgiveness and some that I\u2019m still struggling with. Trusting the Lord through it all can be done, but the Authentic and Vulnerable voice understands even as a follower of Jesus Christ it\u2019s not always easy as we are often told. <strong>Study</strong>: <strong>Gal 5:22; 6:7 and Cor 3:6-9</strong></p><p><strong>Subscribe to this podcast</strong> and Join me as we take this journey together, as two are better than one <strong>(Ecclesiastes 4:9-12)</strong>. I will be Authentic and Vulnerable as I will share my experiences, along with guests that I\u2019m taking time to ask God in prayer for His guidance alone, for who they are to be, so that we can help you achieve a peace and relation with our Father in heaven that cannot be moved by the things and obstacles on our earthly path.</p>",
