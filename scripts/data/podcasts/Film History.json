        "description": "Many of you may know me as an actress in Michael Crichton\u2019s Premier film \u201cWestworld\u201d in which I played Arlette, robot prostitute who seduced & gave favors to Richard Benjamin. Now Richard was a fantastic actor to work with especially because he knew I was uncomfortable having to disrobe and undress. \n\nRichard might have been uncomfortable during that scene but I never noticed a hint of it. Off-screen he was a happily married man to a beautiful and highly talented actress Paula Prentiss, known for her comedy roles in many films. \n\nI\u2019d like to mention that when actors don't have any lines of dialogue, it\u2019s not as easy as you would think. Without words, the character has little to work with. As an audience, think about it and imagine what or how You would convey your thoughts to another person if you were unable to speak. Well, if you don\u2019t agree, try it sometime. It isn\u2019t easy my friends. \n\nAlso, it was inferred that handsome James Brolin was having his way with another saloon gal. FYI - As an aside, James Brolin is married to the iconic \u201cOut of this World\u201d Singer, Actress, Award-Winning Barbra Streisand. \n\nMeanwhile, Brolin's character was being pursued by the Man in Black, Gunslinger Yul Brynner who was brilliant, outstanding, and very scary. Mr. Brynner was best known for being the staunch King in the legendary film \"The King and I\" with Award-Winning actress Deborah Kerr.  \n\nNow regarding television, there was a well-known series called The Green Hornet (Green Hornet Music.. )in which you may know me as VAMA, the One and Only woman in history to \"ZAP\" the Great, Incomparable Bruce Lee as CATO.  During and between \"takes\" Bruce and I would talk at length about so many things but honestly He did most of the talking. He said he didn't easily open up to others but felt like he'd known me for a long time. That he felt safe & very comfortable. \n\nIn The Batman 66 series (Batman Music)  I was The Riddler's female villain \"MOTH\". I will be giving fans much to chew on when talking about the show's Hero Adam West, his sidekick Burt Ward and the forever Memorable Frank Gorshin. Certainly More to share at another time. \n\nThere are a slew of many other series such as Bewitched with Elizabeth Mongomery and Dick York, Lost in Space, Bonanza, and my Introductory and very first role in Ben Casey as well as many other roles in which I guest-starred.\n",

Obscuria Filmcast explores the countless films of note that have slipped through the cracks of history for one reason or another.  Our selections include box office flops that went on to become cult classics, made-for-TV movies that hold a special place in our hearts, groundbreaking documentaries that you've probably never heard of, as well as any obscure film with an emphasis on the strange, surreal, or grotesque.  Each week we rotate to a different host who presents a film for the other hosts to watch for the upcoming episode.
