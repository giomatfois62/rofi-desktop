        "description": "Josh and Alex (whose internet pseudonyms are Karif_Wins and dRafterDemon respectively) have been drafting Magic: The Gathering for many years now, listening to other podcasts and gaining skills through osmosis. Now, they want to improve their skills by creating a podcast that deep dives weekly into competitive Limited gameplay while also acknowledging the hilarity of the MTG grind. \n\nDusk//Dawn is a conversational podcast which leverages both Josh and Alex's obsessions to continually explore the inner workings of modern limited Magic. As a secondary goal, it's also self-aware of the fact that the hosts still don't have perfect knowledge of how to play the game. Strategy, commentary, game design criticisms, bad heuristics, and comedy are all fair game while talking. For those obsessed with Magic commentary like Josh and Alex, Dusk//Dawn is the chaser for the more analytical and technical Magic podcasts about Limited.\n\nExplicit Content -- Swearing\nIntro and outro song courtesy of the Free Music Archive\nJesse Spillane - Sinking Feeling\nJesse Spillane - Number 0",

Oh no. Our sessions are filled with laughter, jokes and plenty of messing about. We don't get too serious, and we're not afraid to get drunk every once in a while.</p><p>Each season, we'll be taking you on a journey through a different TTRPG. From Dungeons &amp; Dragons to Call of Cthulhu and many more each season, we're always up for trying something new. And along the way, we'll be sharing our thoughts, experiences, and of course, plenty of laughs.</p><p>So sit down, chill out, and join us for a little TTRPG fun. You never know what will happen, but one thing is for sure - it's always a great time with our group.</p><p>This podcast contains adult language and themes</p>",
