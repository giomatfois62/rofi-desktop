        "description": "Meet Gemma and Aisling. They have worked in the UK as meteorologists for over ten years. Gemma came up with the idea that maybe others might like to listen to the non stop conversations they still have all these years later about the weather.\n\nOver the years they have forecast for festivals, farming, road, rail, energy, media, aviation and even the humble ice cream demand forecast and so much more. They have gone through job changes, life changes and delved in and out of many hobbies and somehow the weather still weaves in and out of their lives. \n\nSo this podcast is for anyone who would like to join our weather conversations and wherever the jet stream may take us!\n                                   \nWe hope you join us for our bi weekly chat and leave each episode loving the weather just that little bit more.",

        "description": "At the start of 2010's spring semester, APSU student, W.S. Walker walked out of his dorm room in the middle of a blizzard with only two blank books, and lived the next 44 days without any money or ID, going where the wind blew. Because of a single discovery, he stopped everything to walk out into the world, throwing wide open all of his defenses, and making himself completely vulnerable to anyone he met. And what was the discovery which caused this? The massive hidden secret behind what laughter is and why we find something funny. \n<p><p>\nHave you ever tried to explain why somethings are funny and somethings aren't? Tune in to W. S. Walker's The Laughing Matters, the ground-breaking book, read chapter by chapter by the author (and then all manner of advice, musings, and wisdoms after Season 1), and hang on as he sends you reeling through some of the most incredible discoveries on human behavior, why we don't feel right so much of the time, and the core blueprint for the universal design of happiness; things hidden in plain sight your entire life and answers that you never would have expected. The moment you hear them, you will understand that you've always known them.<p>The true motivations behind why we laugh will shock you to your core.<p>\n<p><p><i><b>A fair bit of warning: once you hear some of the hidden truths, you cannot unhear them. They are night and day obvious once you know which angle to see them from. </b></i><p><p>\n\nThis is an advanced edition. The book has not been publicly released yet. If you want a much better understanding of who you are, why you don't feel important, where so much of your internal conflict (at a base-level) comes from, come on in and have a listen. <p><p>\n\nI've got some good news, and some bad news for you.\n<p><p>\nyoutube.com/couldhelp<p>\nwww.thelaughingmatters.com<p>\nfacebook.com/icouldhelp<p>\nwillhelpmail@gmail.com\n\n",

Est\u00e1 inspirado en la pel\u00edcula de Christopher Nolan: OPPENHEIMER, que me hizo empezar a investigar sobre el tema hasta llegar hasta aqu\u00ed.</p><p>En el primer cap\u00edtulo empezaremos sobre la base, Desmontando el n\u00facleo del \u00e1tomo. En \u00e9l veremos importantes nombres del mundo de la f\u00edsica te\u00f3rica como Niels Bohr o Lise Meitner. Despu\u00e9s de este cap\u00edtulo introductorio iremos directos a una de las secuencias que pudimos ver en la pel\u00edcula.</p><p>La pila de Chicago, mejor conocida como La Pila de Fermi. La construcci\u00f3n del primer reactor nuclear en el que se aceleraron part\u00edculas creando una reacci\u00f3n en cadena. Proseguiremos con Luz verde en La colina.</p><p>La colina era como conoc\u00edan los habitantes cercanos a la zona de Los \u00c1lamos. Comprenderemos aqu\u00ed la situaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de la \u00e9poca y la gran inversi\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica en la que un proyecto militar necesitar\u00eda de los avances de la f\u00edsica para llevarse a cabo.</p><p>Y Ahora Oppenheimer, un cap\u00edtulo en el que conoceremos m\u00e1s sobre la historia de este peculiar personaje. Su cara A y su cara B. Con \u00e9l concluimos este p\u00f3dcast. Sin m\u00e1s, te invito a que me dejes tu feedback.</p><p>Han sido semanas de investigaci\u00f3n y profundizaci\u00f3n en el tema para poder realizar este proyecto, libros, art\u00edculos, podcast, documentales y pel\u00edculas para conseguir toda la informaci\u00f3n necesaria y recopilarla en estos 4 cap\u00edtulos. Os pedir\u00eda una ayuda, para llegar a m\u00e1s gente, si sab\u00e9is de alguien a quien le pueda interesar este p\u00f3dcast, no dud\u00e9is en compartirlo.

But in an age dominated by space science, it is imperative that people have an understanding of it, and why not start this experience with some conversation? This podcast hopes to inspire everyone to never stop thinking about what lies there when you look up! We'll be delving into astronomy research, internship opportunities, interviews with professionals, and more! Stay tuned for more!</p>",
