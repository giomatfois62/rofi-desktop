Retell old love stories, recount fleeting romances, maybe even consult some experts, you know, get professional help. Because we really don\u2019t want to marry each other. I mean we like each other fine but it\u2019s more of a structural issue. And if you can\u2019t read between the lines, we both like boys.

        "description": "Integrating the twin Great Commission tasks of language learning and gospel communication, Language 180 gets to the heart of gospel fluency across cultures. \n\nLanguage 180 is a reorientation, a complete pivot in perspective: We're reminded that language learning is something we don\u2019t have to do before we share the gospel, rather something we get to do while we share the gospel.\n\nLanguage 180 is a reminder to persevere when we're tempted to plateau. Language 180 also refers to the minutes we spend every day in ongoing learning toward a sustained lifestyle of evangelism and discipleship in the language. In other words, through Language 180 we practice learning the language to communicate the gospel 3 hours per day, 60 minutes in each of three activities - personal preparation (1st hour), deliberate practice (2nd hour), and fluent proclamation (3rd hour) - for a total of 180 minutes each day. Want to learn more? Start with the first episode, \"What is Language 180?\"\n\nIn the Language 180 podcast, we explore core concepts that sync with articles and resources found on the language180.com website where we learn to: 1) Understand the basics of gospel fluency across cultures 2) Align our perspective with God\u2019s perspective on gospel fluency 3) Evangelize our lost neighbors as we learn their language 4) Comprehend and tell simple familiar gospel stories in our new language 5) Engage our neighbors through the limitless radius of the gospel in all life encounters 6) Learn to listen and respond as an integral part of the fluency needed to reach neighbors with the gospel 7) Know what it means to intelligently learn a language 8) Invest in life-long language learning 9) Practice Language 180 for fruitful ongoing learning and in-language ministry 10) Converse the gospel in our new language 11) Share our testimony; pray for our neighbors, and 12) Identify as Kingdom pilgrims, with an unwavering assurance in our destination and an insatiable desire to invite others to join us from the \u201cnations of every language\u201d (Zechariah 8:23).

        "description": "<p>Welcome to our podcast, Conversations about Consultation. This is a series of digital audio files, made with a wide range of guests who have been generous enough to share their thinking on the topic of consultation in education. Our aim is to provide thought-provoking and engaging content that you can access at times and in places convenient to you, growing out of our shared interest in consultation. Emma teaches a module on the M4 doctoral training in educational psychology that includes consultation, and Jessica, Emily and Zahra are all doctoral students currently on placement in local authority settings making use of consultation in their work. Consultation has any number of different definitions and models. Given our training and background, we are especially interested in consultation as it is used in schools and community settings. We see consultation as a particular type of professional helping relationship, one that holds central the idea that it is the relationship between the consultant and those with whom they work that makes the difference. However, one aim of Conversations about Consultation is to speak with guests who perhaps use different lenses, modalities and approaches and who offer something unique and distinctive that can complement or contrast with our own. It may be a current trainee on a different programme whose research interests include consultation, or an early career practitioner reflecting on consultative working in schools. We speak with experienced practitioners from other disciplines who bring their expertise in working with children young people and their families; as well as psychologists who have been working in the field of consultation research and practice for many years. We hope you will find a conversation to listen to that engages your interest, offers a different perspective or even just provokes a new question or idea that leads to further conversations of your own. You can follow us on twitter to join in the conversation at @TheCACpodcast</p>",

I always knew life was this temporary experience- a soul in a borrowed physical body, I wasn\u2019t sure why so many people spent so much time on things that don\u2019t matter at all. I get it now, they just didn\u2019t know. They were all still asleep. \n\nI\u2019m deep and have been writing, philosophizing, and trying to understand life since I\u2019m 10. I moved 18 times across 4 continents by the age of 28, which also made me question pretty much everything. My background is in International Economics and Business, Leadership Development and Emotional Intelligence. I've studied from neuro-linguistic programming\u200b, to Reiki and Akashic records, to natural and holistic nutrition to look at life from a truly holistic perspective\u200b. \n\nThis podcast is a conscious rebellion to shift from a \u200bfear-based system that keeps us small and doubtful to a way of living based on truth, trust and love as we access our own innate wisdom. A new paradigm that starts with radical self-awareness, a new educational system and a conscious way of being human - combining ancient wisdom with modern knowledge. I'll be hosting and bringing you conversations with conscious souls that are part of this shift. \n\nThis new paradigm starts with you.",

I found myself alone in a closed country, with nothing familiar around me. Because of the extreme circumstances, Jesus became more real to me than ever before, and because there was no one else to rely on, I began to hear His voice loud and so clear. Thus we spent our time in conversation. This is a story that's never fully been told, its about how when everything was stripped away and I had nothing left but Jesus to hold on to, how He became more real to me than ever. It was my adventure with Holy Spirit. Raw, real yet true. I came back with new eyes, and a completely fresh perspective. All that mattered was Him. it was a time of growth and renewal. And the ministry there was something else. Everything that happened had a powerful effect on me, and one that would last a life time. ",

        "description": "Naturalies.\n \nMy name is Samantha-Jo, I am the host for this amazing podcast that I am hoping save souls. My reasoning for starting this podcast came about after I gave my life to Christ on July 11, 2021. I started finding myself constantly want to talk about my struggles (HOT: humble, open & transparent), the things that have given me strength, the things God has done for me & most importantly the things I know that God has for me. I know you're thinking \"oh here we go with some religious podcast\" but I'm asking that you look deeper than that. I am a Christian & yes I pray this podcast changes lives in ways beyond my belief but if its not enough to convince you to stay I will also mention the other things I am that God has allowed me to be. I am a single Mother of 4, YES FOUR amazing boys who at the end of this year will be 12, 6, 4 & 2. I am a business owner (if you have instagram JosCraftShack & Sheis.waisted).  I am also a nurse, I have been for almost 4 years now. So again if religion isnt enough to convince you to stay then stick around for the other things I have to offer.\n\nWhy Naturalies?\nI recently (1 year ago) left a very toxic relationship after 8 years & literally started completely over in the middle of the pandemic with all 4 children. I literally built my own kitchen table, tv stand, coffee table, my bed & childrens bed & started over knowing only what I thought I knew. Black women have been placed in boxes all of our lives. \"Starting over is harder than you think so you should probably stay\" \"You cant do it without this person or that person\", \"You have to act this way, its not lady like to do it that way\", \"You cant jump out on faith because nobody in our family has done that\", \"You cant be better than what you come from\", \"your idea isnt good enough to take you there\" ALL LIES, LIES, AND MORE LIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PLACED ON BLACK WOMEN & LADIES YOU DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE TO MEET ANY STANDARD YOU, YOURSELF, DID NOT SET! This is my safe haven for black women, no matter what you look like, your body size, your bank account or profession, single mom, married mom, in a bad situation, left a bad situation LISTEN I do not care. Come, let your hair down, act the way you want to act even if it doesn't make sense to anyone else, cry a little, heal a lot & know that this is a sisterhood.\n\nIm so ready for this journey. I love you ladies. ",

This evolution is alarming even as it is delightful to me, to discover layers of myself, to move out of my comfort zone, to not be afraid to see what I can become.  \nThe journey really started when at the ripe old age of 47 I joined the motherhood fraternity, which I tell you is a different ball game entirely, parenting truly brings unexpected surprises.\n\nI want to speak up about the issues that concern me because they may affect my child when she grows up, hoping my voice will multiply and move us into positive action.\n\nJoin me as I chat over coffee on life, parenting, books I'm reading, and all that takes my fancy.  \n\n",

        "description": "Hey y'all! My name is DaAujana and welcome to my spoken word diary. Inspiration for this diary was drawn from a multitude of sources, but the main one being high school and my first semester of college. I've always been shy and introverted and isn't a bad thing by any means, but it has caused me to feel an overwhelming amount emotions that have been not so good along the way. The biggest thing I've had to cope with is being alone and not feeling so confident sometimes - and because of that, it has caused me in the past and in the present to withstand what feels to be an uphill battle. Thus, I want to share my stories with all of you because we are going through our own ups and downs. We are all impacted by the actions of our world and instead of remaining shy and silent, I want to use my voice to empower others through sharing my own stories(both serious and ridiculous ones) and truly journey through the process of stepping out of ones embarrassment, shyness, shame, etc and truly being who you are. This journey is also like a mini journal for me to spill out and say all of the things that I have wanted to express for so long, but hadn't because I was too afraid to- I can only hope that through my courage and my words that it will encourage you all to feel empowered to truly be unapologetically yourself and slowly show people the real you and step into your true prime.\u26a1\ufe0f",

There are many things in life to prepare for: college, gameday, a career, marriage, having a family, owning a home, retirement. Preparing for these endeavors is part of life\u2019s journey; personally, I have worked to prepare myself for many of them. But even more, I am in the process of preparing myself for an even greater event than getting married or owning my own home, as great as these things are. I am preparing to meet the King who is coming back someday for His people. \n\nDear Listener, my name is Josiah Moldenhauer, and the purpose of this podcast is to help you prepare as well, prepare to meet this King of the Ages who is coming soon for those who believe in Him and follow Him. Who is this King? He is also known as the King of Glory. He is the Chosen One who came to redeem us back to God from our sin and shame that we may know Him as Father and save us from Hell that we might know Heaven as home. \n\nJesus Himself tells us at the end of the book of Revelation: \u201cBehold, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to everyone according to what he has done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city. Outside are the dogs, those who practice magic arts, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood. \u2018I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches. I am the Root and Offspring of David, and the bright Morning Star.\u2019\u201d (Revelation 22:12-16, NIV 1984). \n\nDear Listening Friend, have you washed your sin-stained robes in the blood of the Lamb? I\u2019m so glad I have! He has forgiven and cleansed me of my sins. If you have never met the Savior, He stands at the door of your heart and knocks. Open the door to Him while there is still time; you do not want to be left outside in the dark. Hell is as terrible and real as Heaven is glorious. Jesus said, \u201cThe thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10, ESV). Jesus offers true spiritual life with God now and for eternity. He is the only one who gives living water that quenches our thirsty souls. \n\n \u201cThe Spirit [of God] and the bride say, \u201cCome!\u201d And let him who hears say, \u201cCome!\u201d Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life (Rev. 22:17, NIV). \n\nDear friend, join me on a journey of knowing and following this Jesus together as we prepare for His glorious coming! As we learn to believe in Him, to love Him with our lives, and to long for His return. Our King is coming back soon! He told us, \u201cTherefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come\u201d (Matt. 24:42, NIV).\n\nGrace and Peace to you in Jesus Christ the Lord. \n",

Unfortunately Christianity as a whole has failed to be evidence of the Glory of God among men, but this was the first thing that Christ did in all His works. So how could we possibly declare the deity of the word made flesh and fail to reflect all that he made possible in us? \n\n   From one end of God's word to the other, we were warned of the short comings that would befall much of the body of Christ. This is the venue designed to give revelation of the elements that have effectually hindered us from walking as Son's of the most high. The question is what will you do once you know the truth? \n   In the call of a modern day Apostle it is imperative that my actions and intent clearly manifest honor of all that God is. Moreover I declare nothing of myself except that I must be subject to the directives of His Holy Spirit.  For even as in times past, a true Apostle must glorify God in all of his endeavors. The mandate to point the hearts of man back to Father God is the sole purpose of my ministry efforts. A messenger need not prove a thing, God will reveal Himself. That is to all who dare to truly seek Him.\n   Change isn't a hard thing at all. the problem is accepting that there is a need for change.

        "title": "Bill Crockett: Touch of the Master's Hand",
        "description": "The \"Touch of the Master's Hand\" is a Christian poem written in 1921 by Myra Brooks Welch. It is depicted in the painting by Ken Brooks used in our Podcast cover art. It tells of an old, battered violin that is about to be sold as the last item in an auction. The highest bid was $3. When suddenly a man in the back of the auction hall walked to the front of the building, took the violin from the auctioneer, wiped off the dust, tuned it and began to play. As he played, the patrons could hardly believe that such a melody could come from such a battered instrument. The violinist finished playing, handed the instrument back to the auctioneer, and walked back to his seat. Amazed and astonished the auctioneer softly said, \"Now how much am I bid for this violin?\" Instead of $3, the violin was sold for $3,000. The crowd asked, \"What was it that suddenly brought value to such a battered instrument?\" The auctioneer replied, \"It was the touch of the master's hand!\" The poem goes on to draw the analogy between the violin and a person whose life has been battered and torn by sin. Just as the master violinist brought value to the old violin, Jesus, our Creator, the Master of the universe and lover of our soul, will make our lives valuable, no matter how battered we may be!\n\nBill Crockett has a masters degree in Biblical Exposition and has served as an evangelist, pastor, counsellor and Bible Conference speaker across the US and in many countries. Bill also worked in corporate sales and sales management for almost 25 years. Having experienced divorce, the loss of a job, death of an immediate family member and depression to the point of suicide, he understands the ups and downs of life. At one point feeling as if God did not love or care about him, he discovered the true meaning of a personal walk with God and found renewed purpose and value as God touched his life once again!\n\n\"Touch of the Master's Hand\" is a podcast sharing practical truths from the Bible that will help us realize our value and live productive and fulfilled lives as we are touched by the truth of God's Word.",

So let's figure out what they are - especially when it comes to very important things like our relationships. We have two choices when we encounter a principle: 1) align with it; or, 2) ignore it to our peril. Take the principle of gravity: we can align with it\u2013 build a hydroelectric dam, start a skydiving company, build a ski resort, etc.\u2013or we can ignore it to our peril and fall off a cliff. Gravity doesn\u2019t change. Our respect and alignment (or not) with the principle is the only thing that changes. Principles govern relationships, too. They, like gravity, are ancient and timeless. And we have the same choice: align or ignore. Learn how principles govern the consequences of all of our choices.</p><p>-EksAyn Anderson <a href=\"http://xfactoredge.com\">xfactoredge.com</a></p>",

Topics on Mondays, which I call Mana\u02bbo Monday share Hawaiian culture lessons I learned from my kupuna (elder), Kumu (teacher), and kula (school) in Hawaii. On Fridays, which are called Aloha Fridays I highlight formal Hawaii residents by talkingstory with them about their relocation journey and experiences.  \n\nThis podcast intends to share the voices and stories of native Hawaiians, aka K\u0100NAKA MAOLI, and the Hawaiians of heart, that relocated away from our homeland of Hawaii.  My goal is to share these stories so we can all learn about others and understand the different situations.  Because the more we know the more we grow. \n\nContact me or leave feedback at: hawaiiabroad.haap@gmail.com\n\nDonations to support the operating expenses of this podcast are greatly appreciated.

Paul Reza Afshar explores the wonderful and sometimes weird ways our mums make us who we are today with famous faces from the BBC, The Witcher (Netflix) and ITV, opening up about the relationships with their mums. \n\n\nOver the course of a light-hearted 40-minute conversation, \u2018My Mum Made Me\u2019 explores the wonderful ways in which mums make successful actors, athletes, authors and activists, told through their childhood stories.\n\nBehind every successful person is a magnificent mum, with all her love and eccentricities. And although we may not recognise them at the time, it\u2019s these eccentricities that make us who are today.  My Mum Made Me unpacks the light and the dark when it comes to relationships with our mums. ",

From their history together to past experiences and even people that came after their relationship, they will comically and openly give their insight. While this may be full of laughs and innuendos, it will also explore some deep and personal topics and touch on all the ways relationships can develop, grow and change over time and everything in between. Ex BestFriends will either leave you in deep thought or trying to make sure nobody can tell you're listening to two people talk about their sex lives - just depends on the episode!

The better our work, the more likely we are to positively impact this world. Understanding is also a way to access knowledge, and knowledge is power. If you want to build a better place, start with listening. That is not all! Because if you listen well and try to understand all sides, you will find that you have so much more than your own story. Because in this world of ours that is so small and so fragile, we are bound together by stories. In such a world, curiosity, patience, open-mindedness, and empathy would be highly valued qualities. People would recognize the power of understanding and would actively strive to cultivate these qualities within themselves and their communities. By embracing the richness of diverse stories, this world would become a more harmonious and inclusive place, where every individual's experiences and perspectives are acknowledged and respected.</p>",

And what do you do when shared history or other ties are strong enough to want to try to maintain some connection despite these differences?\n\nI believe listening is not the same as being complicit with ideas we don\u2019t agree with.\n\nIf we sever all ties with those whose political beliefs we disagree with, how will be able to recognize the humanity in anyone who opposes our own beliefs?\nAs one of the people I interviewed stated, \u201cIf we can\u2019t even talk to our family about this, how are we ever going to talk to strangers about it?\u201d\nThis podcast is not about trying to make expert pronouncements on the subject, but rather an opportunity to give voice to the anxiety, sadness, and fear many are experiencing about this subject.",

Most of their friendship has been long distance and paired with their busy lives, it seemed to be a recipe for disaster. But, over the years, they have shared music as a way to reach out, keep in touch, and keep tabs on each other. Whether it was through collaborative playlists, seasonal playlists, or even a quick song here and there; Two Weeks From Tuesday is unique in its approach, serving as a podcast as well as a platform for new artists. And when they can\u2019t be live and talking to you, they\u2019re still with you through corresponding playlists made for their listeners for every episode. \n\nThis podcast truly wraps music and life into one entity and demonstrates how essential music is to the human experience. Most of all, Two Weeks From Tuesday aims to be honest. Co-creators, Aliya Bloom and Erynn Wakefield, truly want to reach out to their listeners with a helping hand and say, \u201cwe understand.\u201d \n",

We are both full time parents and independent working artists (rapper/comedian Old Man Saxon and filmmaker/musician Baby Luck).</p><p>Life is busy and messy, and we both do so much and feel so much the other person doesn't appreciate or even know about. So we decided to create this podcast, where we will each sit down separately for 3 minutes, 4 nights a week, Monday thru Thursday, to record what happened for us that day. We will not edit or do multiple takes. When our 3 minutes are up, we stop. Then it's the next person's turn. Simple!</p><p>On the weekends, we record our 30 minute Weekend Edition together, where we review the week and finish unfinished business, available exclusively on <a href>Patreon for as little as $5/month</a>.</p><p>Making this podcast together is our way of doing something consistently and simply, in the midst of all our respective long term creative goals and projects, that often drain us and leave us feeling depleted. We hope you'll come along on this journey with us as we find our way by being candid, honest and most importantly, seeing and listening to each other. We'll do this as long as it helps our marriage.</p><p>Thank you for being here with us! We hope this makes you feel more connected in an increasingly disconnected world.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Britt and Sax</p>",

Join the discussion here with Dr. Stephen Woolverton, Associate Pastor at Chandler Light &amp; Life Church, as we discover how to strengthen our faith together. We may charge into Monday with a sense of Godly purpose, but often our strength and determination tend to buckle under the weight of the world and daily stress. How can we deal with the pressures of work, school, family, relationships, society, and even self, when Sunday only comes once every seven days? In this podcast we discuss the battles you face during the week, and seek out biblical weapons we can use for our spiritual conflicts. I pray that you come away from these podcasts with a sense of hope, strength, and faith like that of the Centurion.</p>",

The podcast also aims to inspire and show solidarity to those in the community who are not yet able to come out. For some in the community, coming out is especially difficult. There may be safety issues, religious considerations, family pressures, or even a fear of death that prevents an individual from claiming their LGBTQ+ identity. Like the coming out experience itself, the format of the OUT podcast is meant to honor each individual's story. The interviewer allows each guest to freely tell their story without interruptions, and waits till their story is complete before engaging in a curious and genuine dialogue. Please enjoy the compelling stories of resilience, joy, and freedom in OUT.</p>",

This is the very bases for many disciplines advocating for more organic produce. When there is a disturbance in the bodies state of ease or comfort, don\u2019t we end with dis-ease. Science teaches that all organ systems, including the skin function to maintain homeostasis. Imbalance leads to disorder which results in disease. The word dis-ease was first used to literally refer to lack of ease or comfort. The prefix \u2018dis\u2019 simply references the state of lack or disequilibrium.

Maar we zijn niet zomaar een doorsnee paar \u2013 we zijn druk bezig met het verkennen van de wereld van ethische non-monogamie en polyamorie binnen onze relatie. En laten we eerlijk zijn, dat is soms best wel een kronkelige weg. We misten de ervaringen van anderen en inzichten tijdens dit avontuur, dus hebben we besloten om deze podcast te lanceren. \"If you dont't see the change, be the change.\"</p><p>Ons doel? We willen graag onze frisse, nieuwe ervaringen met jou delen en hopen dat jij er ook iets uit kunt halen. Maar dat is niet alles. Naast het duiken in de wereld van ethische non-monogamie en polyamorie, snijden we ook regelmatig andere onderwerpen aan die gerelateerd zijn aan de LGBTQIAP+ gemeenschap.</p><p>Maar, en dit is belangrijk, we willen wel even duidelijk maken dat we niet de alleswetende experts zijn. In feite nemen we je mee in ons proces terwijl we zelf nog aan het ontdekken zijn. We weten dat we onderweg tegen allerlei uitdagingen gaan aanlopen. Dus, neem alsjeblieft niet alles wat we zeggen als d\u00e9 onwrikbare waarheid, maar eerder als onze gedachten en bevindingen op dat moment.</p><p>Als je nog dieper in de onderwerpen wilt duiken die we bespreken, raden we je zeker aan om naast onze podcast ook andere bronnen te raadplegen. Hoe dan ook, we hopen dat je ontzettend veel plezier beleeft aan het luisteren naar onze gesprekken!</p><p>Oh, en vergeet niet om ons te volgen:</p><p>https://instagram.com/polymolydepodcast?igshid=MzNlNGNkZWQ4Mg==</p>",

I believe that all women have the desire to be beautiful, both inside and out. Unfortunately, we also have insecurities, whether big or small, that often keep us from finding our beautiful. Most often, these insecurities are simply the lies about ourselves that we believe, or have been told, rather than believing who and <em>whose</em> we are. In this podcast, I will be encouraging women, no matter what season of life they are walking through, that even though life is crazy, busy, and often tangled, they are not alone. I will be providing gentle reminders and ways to be a better \"you\", not only for yourself, but for those who you do everyday life with! I will also be diving into topics on intimacy in marriage and ways to spice things up a little!</p><p>I am Michele Blumentritt, and I am your host. I am looking forward to walking through life's journey with you and sharing my experiences that have brought me to this point.<strong> </strong>I am the youngest of three girls. I have been married for 24 years to man who loves the Lord and leads our family with strength and dedication. I have 3 beautiful children, a son and two beautiful daughters. My passion and excitement to share with other women how to find their beautiful are what inspired this podcast. Life is full of twists and turns, let's navigate through them together!</p>",

Beavers is fantastic because it's the best place to really explore the reality of relationships \u2014 the good, the bad, and the painful and confusing. This podcast helps to illuminate what it means to be intimate with others and what it teaches people about them. It will make you want to strive for a kinder, more fun relationship with others.

Gil and Ren\u00e9e are originally from Detroit, Michigan. Their relationship started with Ren\u00e9e rolling the pencil off her desk and Gil picking it up. They never knew such a small act would create a 37-year legacy of love. Gil and Ren\u00e9e were only 21 when they happily committed to until death do us part. Gil retired from the Air Force, and Ren\u00e9e is a former salon owner who has been an entrepreneur and now an author for over 30 years. They have lived in over 13 cities throughout the United States and Germany. They are proud parents to an amazing and talented daughter, Aharon (pronounced like Sharon, except with an A). After a family tragedy, they also adopted Ren\u00e9e's little sisters (Carmen and Monique).This couple has helped many other couples establish a new habit of love to strengthen their marriage relationship through their tested relationship tools and principles and as marriage facilitators through the Prepare and Enrich Marriage program. Rich Relationship with Gil &amp; Ren\u00e8e podcast is back and ready to move forward and deeper into our relationship strengths and growth areas.

Artsen die zeggen dat er niets aan de hand is en bij de volgende arts sta je al ingepland voor IVF en moet de baarmoeder per direct in een kunstmatige menopauze gebracht worden. </p><p>Dan zijn er nog vrienden die niet zwanger willen worden en het ineens zijn (oepsie), stellen die moeite hebben om ons te vertellen dat ze zwanger zijn en onze omgeving die het ons zo graag gunt dat ze overal van op de hoogte gehouden willen worden. \u200b</p><p>Maar wat willen wij nou echt? Gaan we mee met de maatschappelijke norm of willen we echt graag kinderen. Iedereen heeft een mening hierover en die kan soms je eigen zicht vertroebelen. </p><p>\u200bIn deze podcast luister je naar ons verhaal, onze twijfels, onze pijn en ook ons geluk. We nemen je als luisteraar mee in het proces wat we al gehad hebben en wat nog voor ons ligt. </p><p>Veel luisterplezier </p><p>Liefs Lis en Ruben</p><p>Kijk ook op: <a href=\"https://www.zwangerwordennietzonatuurlijk.nl/\">https://www.zwangerwordennietzonatuurlijk.nl/</a></p><p>Of volg ons op Instagram en Facebook</p><p>@zwangerwordennietzonatuurlijk</p>",

It's about creating a world where women are able to access the same opportunities and rights as men.\n\nThroughout this series, we'll hear from women who are leaders and change-makers in their fields, as well as experts in women's rights and gender equality. We'll share stories of triumphs and challenges, and we'll examine the intersectionality of issues facing women across different cultures, races, and socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nOverall, this podcast aims to inspire and empower women to take control of their lives and break down the barriers that are holding them back.

They went down a path of using illegal means to survive but switched courses after a few years. That switch changed their lives forever. They are now famous youtube stars with over 7 million youtube subscribers and over 1billion views across channels. Their past life unfortunately caught up with them, landing them both in federal prison. They did their time, paid their debt to society and are now sharing their experience with the world; in hope to help people going through legal, financial or relationship issues. They are very raw on their podcast, unlike their known Youtube persona which is family friendly. Join Billy &amp; Eva on BE Unfiltered.</p>",

But first, let me share a personal story related to this topic.</p><p></p><p>    Personally, I've experienced one and I'm currently experiencing the other. At one point I'd found the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with, but it didn't go as planned. We'd been married for awhile, but I did stuff to cause us to separate. Although we're not divorced, we're still friends, but I still wanna spend  my life with her. Being separated completely shifted my perspective on what true love is.</p><p></p><p>Now that we've explored my personal experience, let's dive deeper into the topic itself. This podcast isn't just about me talking. I want to hear from you. If you have any stories, questions or thoughts related to today's topic, you can email me at Da_Heartbreak_Kid@mail.com using #The Heartbreak Happy Hour.

Trueness Of The Words was birthed in me over a decade ago. I could not understand it then why the name came to me so clearly or how I would ever be able to actually use it. What I was clear on, was that God had given me the name.</p><p>I have a strong desire within to give an Authentic and Vulnerable voice to the issues that come upon women, mother &amp; daughter relationships, single women and married women by way of my own hurts and pains that I carry daily and some the daily has turned into years. Longsuffering is what the Word of God calls it. The voice I will give will come with truth, hurts, pains, vulnerability, beginnings, endings, unforgiveness that God has brought me through over to forgiveness and some that I\u2019m still struggling with. Trusting the Lord through it all can be done, but the Authentic and Vulnerable voice understands even as a follower of Jesus Christ it\u2019s not always easy as we are often told. <strong>Study</strong>: <strong>Gal 5:22; 6:7 and Cor 3:6-9</strong></p><p><strong>Subscribe to this podcast</strong> and Join me as we take this journey together, as two are better than one <strong>(Ecclesiastes 4:9-12)</strong>. I will be Authentic and Vulnerable as I will share my experiences, along with guests that I\u2019m taking time to ask God in prayer for His guidance alone, for who they are to be, so that we can help you achieve a peace and relation with our Father in heaven that cannot be moved by the things and obstacles on our earthly path.</p>",
