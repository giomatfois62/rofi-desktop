        "description": "Though veterans of the United States of America liberated others worldwide at immense sacrifice, a little told American story is the unique liberation of the Tuscan people by the Buffalo Soldiers of WWII. After the War ended, these courageous men were sent home to a 'Jim Crow' America. \n\nItalian history is strikingly different. The impoverished, starving Tuscans feel as if they owe their lives to the Buffalo Soldiers, whom they lovingly dubbed 'Giganti Buoni' (Good Giants). An Italian eyewitness said, \u201cThey came down the mountain and freed us, and took care of us.\u201d \n\nIvan J. Houston, who was himself wounded in WWII, served in the Segregated 92nd Infantry Division, which bravely fought and pushed the German Nazis and Italian Fascists back behind  The Gothic Line. Tragically, these \"Black Warriors\" were also forced to fight the U.S. Army\u2019s institutionalized racism, and even individual racist White officers who did not want them to succeed.\n\n\u201cThat was just the way the Army was,\u201d says Mr. Houston, retired CEO of America\u2019s third largest African American-owned corporation. \n\nBetween 1945 and 2011, Mr. Houston returned many times to Italy, meeting the Pope, revisiting his battlefields of old, and honoring his fallen comrades at the Florence-American Cemetery. Then, after writing the book, \"Black Warriors: The Buffalo Soldiers of WWII, with Gordon Cohn, Mr. Houston was introduced by chance to many, many Italian Reenactors who treated him with warmth and respect. Through the hospitality of a gracious Italian woman, Mattea Piazzesi, a unique bond was formed between two families, the Houston's and the Piazzesi's. Ms Piazzesi had discovered Mr. Houston via his book.\n\nMr. Houston investigated missing casualty records with the help of local historians, who found the culprit was General Edward Almond, the racist commander (a fact acknowledged by the U.S. War College), who sent an African American Regiment into deadly battle without warning them to expect a heavy Nazi attack. This caused heavy casualties, which Almond then covered up. \n\nThe documentary film, \"With One Tied Hand\" tells the stirring story of how Tuscan gratitude is finally shown to Mr. Houston, who on behalf of all Buffalo Soldiers is paraded and celebrated on a loving, yearly reenactment of the Liberation of Lucca, the 500-year-old walled city. The film also reveals moving personal stories from surviving eyewitnesses and their families. \n\n\u201cI think this is the only instance in history where African-Americans have liberated another people,\u201d Mr. Houston concludes.",

Zowel in deze podcast als in het museum willen we laten zien hoe kunst en geschiedenis ons wereldbeeld kleuren. Met de tentoonstelling De Pest (2021) werden de eerste podcasts gemaakt. In dit eerste seizoen nemen diverse experts je mee door de geschiedenis van deze bijzondere infectieziekte. Hoe heeft de pest zijn sporen nagelaten in kunst en cultuur? En wat zijn de paralellen met de coronacrisis? Een jaar later was het tijd voor een nieuwe, relevante, tentoonstelling: Moving Stories: de Rijkdom van de Limes. Met deze tentoonstelling worden de migratieverhalen van  2000 jaar geleden gekoppeld met migratieverhalen van nu. Als voorbereiding op de tentoonstelling spraken de curatoren van de expositie, Marie Stel en Marenne Zandstra met een groep mensen die in de regio woont en een migratieachtergrond heeft: het public-in-residence. Ook sprak het public-in-residence, de mensen met een migratieachtergrond dus, met hedendaagse kunstenaars, die naar aanleiding van die gesprekken nieuw werk maakten voor de tentoonstelling. Een gedeelte van die gesprekken kan je horen in het tweede seizoen van de podcast.  ",

HAAA is managed by Rice University's Chao Center for Asian Studies, and located at the Woodson Research Center, Fondren Library. It collects, documents, and preserves the lived experiences of the Asian diaspora in Houston, aiming to develop a broader understanding of history through their lens, which continues to evolve towards the studies of Asia from a transnational perspective. </p><p>The series is produced by Ann Shi, Associate Curator, with guidance provided by Dr. Anne Chao, Program Manager and Co-Founder of Houston Asian American Archive, adjunct faculty of School of Humanities, Rice University. Special thanks to Lisa Balabanlilar, Director of Chao Center for Asian Studies, without whose support this series would not have been possible; and thanks to Haejin Koh and Hae Hun Matos for their meticulous organization.

In an era where people across the country have paused to examine the role that their systems play in perpetuating racism, Southern Methodist University is not exempt. \n\nShara Jeyarajah, an SMU Human Rights Fellow, explores the history of Southern Methodist University through a racial justice lens. From President R. Gerald Turner to students across Greek councils, Shara interviews SMU community members across races and generations to reflect on all that has changed since the era of desegregation-- and all that hasn't. Maladjusted doesn't shy away from the difficult conversations. For instance, what does the name of our university have to do with slavery? Why isn't Greek life as diverse as the rest of campus? What's the difference between the experiences of Black students in the 1960s versus the 2020s? Does SMU have a place in a truly antiracist society? Together, let's tell the truth about our history.",

Sie sehen sich mit einer Mischung aus Repressalien und Erm\u00fcdung konfrontiert, denen der Westen nur Halbherziges entgegenzusetzen wei\u00df.\n\nAnders als letztes Jahr war davon in den letzten Monaten leider nicht mehr viel in den Medien zu sp\u00fcren \u2013 eine Art Grundskepsis hat sich breit gemacht, bedingt durch fehlende Aussichten auf schnellen Erfolg, die Annahme, dass man ob der geopolitischen Verh\u00e4ltnisse ohnehin nur \u00fcber begrenzte Handlungsoptionen verf\u00fcgt oder dass es sich bei Belarus ohnehin nur um ein m\u00e4\u00dfig bedeutsames, weil weit entfernt liegendes Land handelt.\n \nKaroline Gil und Patryk Szostak wollen sich damit nicht abfinden und hinterfragen diese Annahmen, indem sie  Expert:innen, Belarus:innen, internationale Beobachter:innen und Politiker:innen zu Wort lassen. Dass es dabei teils auch zu unterschiedlichen Einsch\u00e4tzungen kommt, liegt in der Natur der Sache, aber in einem herrscht Einigkeit: Es w\u00e4re ein Trugschluss zu glauben, dass die Marginalisierung des Themas in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit realen au\u00dfenpolitischen Gegebenheiten und Verh\u00e4ltnissen entspricht. Ganz im Gegenteil. \n\nDavon war auch der erste Gast bei \u201eWei\u00df-Rot-Wei\u00df\u201c, der Journalist und Publizist Richard Herzinger \u00fcberzeugt, welcher in einem seiner Artikel folgendes konstatierte: \u201eBelarus, das sind wir\u201c. Zusammen mit ihm wollten wir zun\u00e4chst der fundamentalen Frage \u201eWarum?\u201c auf den Grund gehen:\n\nWarum ist Belarus f\u00fcr den Westen wichtig?",

It's a chance to soak up the ambiance of the world's greatest watering holes without leaving your home.\n\nI\u2019m Richard Crouse. I tended bar for seventeen years everywhere from hot spots to dive bars and I thought I had seen it all.\n\nIn my life behind bars I witnessed everything from first dates and marriage proposals to knife fights and a woman who brought a pet monkey in for a drink.\n\nNothing could surprise me.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThen I heard about how a lion who visited Harry\u2019s New York Bar in Paris inspired Ernest Hemingway to write one of his greatest novels. And why there are century old chicken bones hanging above the beer-stained bar at McSorleys in New York City. And how Vincent Sardi refused to do business with the mob during Prohibition, so his famous Broadway Restaurant didn\u2019t serve alcohol until the 21st amendment passed, six year after they first opened.\n\nWith the help of the Last Call radio players, music and interviews with cocktail detectives Jared Brown and Anistatia Miller, The Indiana Jones of Tiki, Jeff \u201cBeachbum\u201d Berry and Two and Two: McSorley's, My Dad, and Me author Rafe Bartholomew, I bring these stories, and many more, to life in my podcast Last Call. It\u2019s fact folded in with a sprinkling of fiction, because, well, who doesn\u2019t exaggerate after a few drinks?\n\nSo, open that bottle of wine or crack that beer and join me for an intoxicating guided tour of some of the strange stories from some of the world\u2019s best boozers.",

Over this podcast series by the Galway Feminist Collective and Promedios Mexico, you'll learn about who the Zapatistas are, their history of struggles and the lessons that we can learn from them, as well as songs and stories from within the movement, bringing each episode to life. The release of this podcast coincides with the Zapatistas' first visit to Europe and aims at giving folks in Ireland (and elsewhere) an insight into the Zapatistas through interviews with some of those who have worked closely with the movement on topics such as community media, womxn's organising, agriculture, education and autonomy, retracing some of the steps that their struggle has taken on its long and steady road to autonomy. Throughout this series, we will highlight their learnings, and obstacles, but above all their creativity and determination to make other worlds a reality.",

From the missing 411, to cryptozoology, aliens and the paranormal, my goal is to provide listeners information without jest or mockery, so that I may not mistakenly make light of a subject many are already too embarrassed or afraid to talk about. I strive to remain family friendly; there will be no profanities or inappropriate conversations. That being said, I advice viewers to still remain  cautious when listening, as these subject matters might prove too much for some audiences to handle, or too frightening for any younger listeners.

        "description": "Throughout this podcast, I hope you will learn more about the Italian television landscape with a focus on shows targeting the youth. From the outside, Italy has often been considered a white society that has been rapidly changing due to immigration, so Italians are faced with a new representation of their country. I aim to explore how televised programming deals with this shift, and I will pay specific attention to minority youth. Through the exploration of five series, I have gathered different presentations of racially/diverse youth in Italian television and how their presences are dealt within these shows. I will address the right to representation for these racial/diverse groups, the depiction of their bodies, and whether these televised programs aim to educate an evolving society. ",

        "description": "Women in Action was an arts and heritage project, led by Collective Encounters in 2020-2022, that used drama and creativity to celebrate women\u2019s resilience, activism and community organising across Merseyside. The Ballad of 18 Women is the major final outcome of the project, incorporating testimonies recorded in oral history interviews as well as poetic narration and original music and song. \n\nThis radio ballad highlights the stories of 18 Merseyside women to give an insight into the incredible contributions women make every day to improve lives in our region. Woven together, they give a glimpse of the multitude of positive actions that hold, nurture and empower our communities.\n\nThe 18 women share a concern for fairness and social justice, but their causes, actions and impacts are many and varied. Some would not consider themselves to be \u2018activists\u2019, but all have given of themselves to help others and in doing that have made the world a better place. The radio ballad pulls some common threads from their stories; the archive collection (available online or on request) offers the full recording for each person, showing the richness of their individual contributions.\n\nWe hope the ballad and recordings will inspire new women activists, as well as sustain, celebrate and encourage those who are already working for change: it is a homage to these 18 women and to you.\n\nWritten by Sarah Thornton\nComposed by Bethany Kay Hopkins\nDirected by Tessa Buddle\nSound Design by Karen Lauke\nArtwork by Doriscakes Creates\n\nFeaturing the voices of: \nAlma Brown, Anna Reid, Anne Gorton, Anya Chapman, Chantelle Lunt, Clara Paillard, Doreen McNally, Felicity Dowling, Imogen Woolley, Johanna Schweier, June Hudson, Keith Barber, Libby Mackay, Lois Woolley, Lynda Cash, Maddy Vaz, Margaret Mariette, Mary O\u2019Sullivan, Olivia Graham, Terri Heldt, Tracey Dunn, Zi Lan Liao\n\nFor more information about Women in Action visit: https://collective-encounters.org.uk/projects/women-in-action/\n\nTo explore the full interviews with the 18 women visit: https://audio.maydayrooms.org/the-ballad-of-18-women \n\nMade possible with funding from National Lottery Heritage Fund, PH Holt Foundation, LCVS, Arts Council England, and Liverpool City Council; archived in partnership with the Museum of Liverpool and MayDay Radio.",

        "description": "The Sparks Museum Podcast is a history-themed podcast offering an immersive storytelling experience to complement the many historic artifacts, exhibits, and stories preserved and displayed inside the Sparks Heritage Museum in Sparks, Nevada. The museum has been dedicated to preserving the historical and cultural heritage of Sparks and surrounding Truckee Meadows  region for the education and enjoyment of present and future generations since its formation in 1985. Be it the origin of the Central Pacific railroad, the significance of the upcoming revitalization of the original Sparks Library, or even the evolution of the museum\u2019s historic Victorian Square building itself, we believe that there are innumerable stories in our community worth sharing.\n\nThis new audio series has the intent of doing exactly that - documenting the stories of the places, people and events that have made the city of Sparks what it is today. Each episode will focus on one of the many tales of Sparks\u2019s history, told by host Jessica Johnson and a special guest local to the area that has been selected based on their expertise in that episode\u2019s subject.\n\nThe Sparks Museum Podcast is funded in part by a grant from Nevada Humanities and the National Endowment for the Humanities. It is produced and recorded at the podcast recording studio at Sparks\u2019s own Ant-Space Coworking Entrepreneurial Hub.\n\nWe want to get the word out about our brand new audio series, so please spread the word about our brand new podcast by taking a moment to rate, review, and share this episode. Do you have a favorite story of Sparks that you want to hear on the podcast? Email info@sparksmuseum.org to share any recommendations.",

        "description": "Venice Talks is a podcast series about Venice in Italy, hosted by Monica Cesarato, who is putting her insider experience at your disposal to help you experience the city at 360 !\n\nThere is a reason why Venice is one of the most visited cities in the world: is it perhaps because its attractions are something absolutely unique? Absolutely so. Nowhere else will you find a city built entirely on water with a glorious history spanning centuries.\n\nBu there are two ways to visit Venice: following the rush of tourists who in a few hours drag themselves along a predetermined route chosen by about 20 million people every year, or leaving this path trying to discover a less postcard-worthy Venice.\n\nI think you can do both: you can go and enjoy Saint Marks\u2019 Square and its monument or the Rialto Bridge admiring the Grand Canal, fighting though with the crowds to be able to take a souvenir photo.\n\nBut you can also get out of the clich\u00e9 about Venice and discover that there are extraordinary places even in a city that in itself is out of any ordinary. Venice is not just about its monuments and its history: it\u2019s about its people, the Venetians.\n\nSo,if you are planning your vacation, or it is already organized but you are looking for more useful tips for visiting Venice, you are on the right place.\n\nThis is a weekly podcast on the Venetian people, their lives and struggles in the city of Venice.\n\nEvery week, Venice Talks aims to find what\u2019s going on among the canals and small alleyways, uncovering the stories and speaking to the people that matter. These conversations aim to animate, educate and create discussions about how to visit Venice the right and sustainable way. We do this through sharing fascinating stories about the past, present and future of Venice. This podcast is a cultural platform to discuss the most salient issues facing our city today and celebrate the people, organisations and stories behind The Serenissima.\n",

        "description": "How humans are manipulated into decisions of right and wrong, good or bad, positive or negative, prompted this discussion. This relates to energy in many forms including spiritual. The gods of the ancient world never left. Their influence is still with us to this day and is growing.\n\nThrough the centuries since creation and the fall, interdimensional ruling entities have overseen the build-up of nations, only to develop the infrastructure and technology to eventually be used to enslave them. Increase the populations in order to dissolve them into regions instead of nation-states. From the individual level, all the way up to global government, influence and decision making is about control.\nThe People need to realize what is going on in the world and not be so willing to give away their freedom, and personal rights. By controlling these aspects of society, religion, banking, politics, medicine, education, media, journalism, government, and law, they win. Let\u2019s make it difficult for them to take control.\n\n\nWhat part of your activities that are destroying our society do you not understand? Why can't you see their plan to remove independent thoughts or opposing opinions? Fear causes most people to be frightened or too scared to express an original opinion or thought. Conformity is easier to be exorcised in society. Standing out is a lonely place to be. This discussion will attempt to alleviate ignorance and provide humanity with the knowledge to overcome this cancer in our world.\n\n\nThese ancient evil entities knew enough to fabricate many versions of a devastating flood, virgin birth, death and resurrection on the third day to confuse the masses. knowing that the fulfillment would come and be legitimate through Jesus.\nAfter Babel, the dispersion and mixing up of languages was a foreshadowing of the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit reversed this and the people present heard the Gospel in their language.\nThe spirits of the dead or ghost are most likely demons pretending to be a departed loved one or important person. This is why God said, do not to communicate with these entities. Venerating or offering sacrifices and summoning the dead is also specifically stated as not to be done.\n\n\nSomething I said a long time ago while sitting in traffic with some friends \u201cif we could accelerate our molecules, we could pass right through these other cars and people.\u201d In all forms of matter, expanded awareness is similar to this, in that it opens up our consciousness to the infinite.\n\nKeywords:\nAkkadian, Altar, Amorites, Ancient Cultures, Angels, Archeology, Armenians, Assyrians, Astrology, Astronomy, Awareness, Aztec, Babylonian, Beliefs, Birth, Blessings, Blood, Bloodlines, Book of Enoch, Books, Canaanite, Censorship, Clergy, Conjuring, Context, Control, Cult, Curse, Dark, Darkness, Death, Deceit, Demon, Destroying Angel, Distractions, Dolmen, Drug, Egyptian, Electro-Magnetic, Elohim, Energy, Entity, Evil, Eyes Open, Fallen, Family, Feeling, Festival, Force, Frequency, Germanic, Ghost, Gods, Government, Greek, Health, Heaven, Hebrew, Hell, Hindu, History, Hittites, Human, Hurrians, Induce, Influence, Information, Judgment, Kingdom, Knowing, Knowledge, Ley Lines, Light, Luwians, Manipulation, Meaning, Mental Health, Mesoamerican, Mesopotamian, Mind, Moabite, Money, Moon, Myth, Mythology, Nation, Negative, Norse, Nutrition, Oath, Offering, Oracle, Pagan, Penance, Perceive, Perception, Persian, Persuasion, Philosophy, Phoenicians, Plague, Planets, Politics, Positive, Possession, Power, Praise, Prayer, Prophecy, Prophet, Psychology, Resurrection, Righteous, Ritual, Roman, Sacrifice, Satan, Scalar, Scripture, Shoal, Sing, Sons of God, Sorcery, Spiritual, Spirituality, Sports, Stars, Sumerian, Sun, Suppression, Symbols, Tartarus, Technology, Thought, Through The Veil, Trans, Understanding, Unseen, Veneration, Watchers, Wavelength, Wicked, Words, Worship\n",

The only clue was a note stuck to the front of the leather-bound, handwritten book with six words; it said \"use this as you see fit.\" If they\u2019re going to figure out why the diary was sent, Angela and Brandon need to investigate each entry to learn more about the author. They\u2019re hoping that reviewing each entry will lead them to the truth behind the mystery diary and why whoever wrote it - and it\u2019s truly unlike anything else - entrusted it to Angela with little guidance, but obvious faith? You\u2019re invited to tune in as a wide array of insightful New Jersey cannabists join Angela and Brandon as they explore and learn from intimate stories told through a powerful voice that appears to have gone silent as of April 20, 2022. \"Use This As You See Fit: The Diary of Mari\" is a podcast for anyone who loves good cannabis or good stories or good stories about cannabis.

This action targeted six Swift & Co. meat packaging plants across the country and resulted in nearly 1,300 arrests. Hundreds of people without documentation were deported in connection to the raids, and although the raid was over in a day the fracturing of families and communities left a lasting mark.\u00a0\n\nSolo \u00c9ramos Ni\u00f1os takes a deep dive into one of the targeted communities and seeks to understand the ways the raid tore into the lives of the children and families that bore witness to it all. The series also examines ways community members have sought to fortify and uplift one another in the aftermath of the raid and what actions can be taken to protect our children moving forward.\n\nJoin hosts, Shelby and Angel Lopez, as they explore the nuances of immigration, Latine culture, first generations, mental health, and hoping for a better life for those that will come after us.\u00a0",

Next, we share with you how this space works.</p><p>- What is said in this podcast corresponds to information supported by bibliography which will be cited in each episode.</p><p>- The intention is to provide information that is useful while keeping respect for any cosmogony and any beliefs. This is a guide rather than a manual on the Tarot and its mysteries.</p><p>- The responsibility for the use of the information belongs to the person who listen and recommend this information. In this space we do not seek to promote ideologies, beliefs or cosmogonies; on the contrary, we seek to gather as much information about each Tarot letter and locate it in some line of knowledge.</p><p>- To understand each other, and to start from a version of the Tarot that we can consult, we will use the Marseille Canon as described by Marianne Costa and Alejandro Jodorowsky in the Book La V\u00eda del Tarot.</p><p>If your tarot deck does not belong to the Marseille Canon or you notice differences in the descriptions, do not disconnect. You will see that you will know your tarot by studying the differences with other decks.</p><p>At Arcana, we are convinced that there is no absolute way to read the tarot, only ways to interpret it. We consider it important to give information that expands the stories symbolically expanded as a result of playing the cards.</p><p>This podcast is a library where topics about the arcana are poured. If your search is based on reading, this space will help you with information about the cards. In the same way we will share the useful information to achieve readings using the Tarot.</p><p>This space is not intended to be a matter of debate, it is just a free and informative space in which we respect the different ways of seeing and thinking about the Tarot. We think more about this space to share experiences and information.</p><p>If what interests you my dear pilgrim is to know about the world of Tarot, or being the case, a deck has come into your hands, I invite you to go through your deck together.</p><p>It is not necessary to have a Tarot available, you can take this space to consult or satisfy some intellectual curiosity.</p><p>The only thing we ask of all participants is to keep their mind open to the information that is shared.</p><p>I remind you that the use of the tools and information that you hear are the responsibility of those who practice and use them.</p><p>With this welcome we begin the transmissions of this podcast. We hope your participation and that you share your experience in the world of Tarot with us and the pilgrims.</p><p>For those who listen to this podcast, it may be something new or curious, but I also know that there are some of our listeners who found us because they are in the learning process.</p><p>The only certainty is that the Tarot in the history of man fulfills a function that is important to us: Save symbolic relationships that have been established over time within the iconography of the Tarot.</p><p>From what you hear, take what works for you.</p><p>This is Arcana.</p>",

Each episode of History On The Go runs roughly for an hour and forty-five minutes, covering two topics per session: One more narrow topic specifically related in some way to the American Civil War, and one broader topic relating to anything regarding general history, be it North American History or World History. History On The Go is dedicated to preserving a fun and respectful round-table discussion, where no one is ostracized for a lack of knowledge or opinion, and where all topics can be discussed fairly, reasonably, and openly. Whilst History On The Go will likely cover some less friendly and kind topics, all history is important to remember and discuss - if we cannot learn from the mistakes and trouble of the past, we cannot help the future to be better. Disclaimers will be provided before any topics we feel particularly troubling, and we are always open to comments, concerns, and what-have-you from any of our listeners.

Geographically this frontier included not only the seven states that make up north east of India but also parts of present day Bangladesh, and Myanmar. The region was part of global networks with dynamic precolonial trade and commerce, and monastic orders. The podcast brings into the fore historical and contemporary revelations about frontiers for academics, students, and the public. We will explore historical narratives, oral traditions, cultural articulations, and fictional representations of spaces understood as frontiers, borderlands, fringes, and margins. Talking Frontiers will introduce listeners to the north east of India through interviews with historians, writers, folklorists, and journalists. It is crucial to juxtapose written histories and written text with oral histories and sources, to ask critical questions about which narratives are more dominant and why.</p><p>The first series focuses on North East India and is supported by the Centre for Research in History at O.P.Jindal Global University.</p><p>The series is produced by Reeju Ray and Radio JSJC, Siddhartha Pillay and Tushar Singh students of Jindal School of Journalism and Communication.</p><p>Instagram: @talking_frontiers </p><p>Twitter: @reejuray4</p>",

The Ocheti Sakowin is the Seven Council Fires, which is made up of the Dakhota, Lakhota and Nakhota Oyates.</p><p>The Moccasin Telegraph is about truth telling. If I, or any one on the podcast miseducates, please let us know. We want the information going out to be based in truth. Following the ways of our ancestors in speaking with respect and honor.</p><p>Education of the history of our land-based cultures past, present, and future is essential to re-Indigenizing the Ocheti Sakowin Oyate and The Moccasin Telegraph will be part of that education. Along with that education, The Moccasin Telegraph podcast will delve into topics that address food sovereignty, watersheds, microbes, ecosystems, historical trauma, mental health education, housing, education, oral and written language, equine therapy, treaties, land base/back, being a citizen of the Ocheti Sakowin, homelessness, the Ocheti Sakowin governance system, child development and parenting, to name a few. The idea is to share The Moccasin Telegraph podcast on the internet, radio stations, classrooms, with families and one another. We will involve relatives who will share their knowledge, stories and skills. The Moccasin Telegraph may eventually bring in video stories and video podcasts but will begin with it in audio form. We have an incredible culture to teach and bring forth to help in bringing back health to all our relatives.</p><p>Our culture has thrived and endured hardships for tens of thousands of years and I give thanks and appreciation to those relatives before me. I am proud to say I am Lakota and Nakota! Let us come together with good hearts and open minds to heal. Pilamaye lo!</p>",

I majored in History with a minor in Education, and decided to do my final senior thesis on my favorite genre of music: the blues. With the help and encouragement of the History Department of the College of Wooster, I was able to create 5 episodes outlining my historical argument. I explored the songwriting of blues musicians in the 1960s, when their genre was most popular.</p><p>Now, the podcast has become my own median of storytelling and historical thinking when it comes to music.

As graduates of the Class of 2002, we carry with us a treasure trove of memories, friendships, and life lessons that have shaped us into who we are today.</p><p>Our podcast is a tribute to the vibrant community that Sunnyslope embodies. It's a celebration of the remarkable journeys of our fellow alumni who have gone on to make their mark in various fields, from the arts to entrepreneurship, sports to community leadership. We believe that the stories of our alumni are powerful reminders of the potential that our beloved school nurtures within each one of us.</p><p>By sharing these stories, we aim to inspire and connect. We want to ignite a sense of pride in being a Viking, fostering a sense of unity and camaraderie that transcends time and distance. Through engaging discussions and heartfelt interviews, we hope to capture the essence of Sunnyslope \u2013 its spirit, its impact, and the endless opportunities it presents.</p><p>The Sunnyslope Alumni Podcast is our way of giving back to the community that has given us so much. It's a platform to honor the past, celebrate the present, and look forward to the bright futures our alumni are creating. We invite you to join us on this journey of nostalgia, inspiration, and shared aspirations as we bring the Sunnyslope community together once again.</p><p>Thank you for being a part of our podcast family.</p><p>Warm regards, Gilbert Gallahar and Julie Bustamante Hosts of the Sunnyslope Alumni Podcast</p>",
