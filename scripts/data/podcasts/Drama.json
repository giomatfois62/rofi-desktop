And yet, he fears neither his enemies, the endless torture, nor death but the eventual ruin of his people under their hateful claws. Doubtful of her charged task, a young woman, Royal Messenger under guidance from the only Master Enchanter, undertakes an impossible mission: seeking help from a mythical and almost forgotten demigod. <strong>AGENTS OF THE DARK ONE </strong>\u2013 A final heartbeat, demons at the door, an appeal for help, and a chance bridge across the void of the Unknown\u2026 violations of metaphysical law during the rescue of Prince Kajor have brought the inescapable wrath and cold justice of Spectres; dark retribution and a singular, violent death stalk Royal Messenger Marie. Back home, bereft of any trace of his adventure, Paul is heartbroken amidst questions about his own sanity. Rothson can only hope his final expenditure of Power will reach demigod and enchanter before disaster befalls and all that they have achieved is overturned. <strong>ENCHANTER\u2019S LOT</strong> \u2013 A faint breath of shadow whispers past Maximillian amidst his private ritual of black magic, bidding him find someone; Paul helps Marie adjust to existence in his complicated world, unaware of the dark forces seeking them out; Enchanter Gaiwan's manhunt for a renegade sorcerer turns sour, bringing upon him the wrath of dragons, and a nearly impossible errand. Relentlessly, all are drawn to meet across <strong>A BRIDGE OF DOOM.</strong></p><p>A lot of time and energy is required to present my <strong>THEATRICAL AUDIOBOOKS</strong>, to provide productions of my published novels with the high quality and detail I expect of myself in this personal endeavor.

Five palatial terraces of land are connected by a myriad of bridges over gulches where the brambles of a colossal, petrified rose briar reside. But this seemingly-tranquil city seethes with dark secrets and otherworldly threats amass in its shadows.\n\nSevardin Harker, a newly minted member of the Amagium\u2019s Peacekeeping Force, is thrust into the deep end on his second day on the job, when he has a life-threatening encounter with a form of magic most people believe to be fiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hace Matthews and Alinore Valmont, two precocious aspiring peacekeepers, begin their 11-year matriculation at Arroyo\u2019s Athenaeum, the Amagium\u2019s rigorous training ground...\n---\n\nFor more episodes, references, and other information, please visit AnnoAmagium.com.

As a child I read Dickens, Tolkien, Eddings, Stevenson\u2026 I trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School receiving outstanding training from Voice Specialists Francis Thomas and Lynette Irving, refining my vocal technique and flexibility, plus excellent radio technique training from BBC producer Brian Miller.

This podcast takes one small element of this, Short Stories, and brings these to the world. They range in length, genre, and energy, from very short, five-minute sparks of life to some that are around 45min. The subjects of the stories are also highly diverse, from sweet little stories about birds to psychological thrillers. \n\nAll writers and performers live in the Northern Rivers area, from Byron Bay westwards however inspiration draws from anywhere and everywhere.\n\nSit back and be transported by the magic of creative storytelling from one of the most creative places in the world. \n",

A few, like Draco, exist on the outskirts of society. Not that Draco minds, his life is simple and respectable. He runs a business he loves and keeps his head down. It's not perfect, but for Draco, it's more than enough. That is, until he makes the ill-advised decision to help a very drunk Harry Potter.</p><p>Potter, true to form, takes this as an open invitation to not only invade Draco's home, but also to drag Draco into the political mess that Wizarding Britain has become. And of course he does, because how can Harry Potter come into contact with anyone, and not get them involved in the self sacrificing bullshit that is saving the world?</p><p>Abruptly Draco's well curated life is careening out of control, and worse, his stupid heart is chasing right on after it.</p>",

Despite the increase in unexplainable disasters and missing people, the U.S. government's own \"Council of Human Development\" has made no moves since the 1980's. So, a member of the DoE tries yet again to form an underground group aimed at protecting people before it's too late. Too bad it's these guys... This is a set of test recordings from a homebrew modern world based on mythos built up over 2 unrecorded campaigns (technically 1 and 1/2, since the \"second\" campaign used the same characters). System used is Monster of the Week, a Powered by The Apocalypse game created by Michael Sands. It's been heavily customized and most likely none of us are following the rules as intended. Note: A lot of the beginning of this was recorded on a 15 dollar recorder. Everyone makes mouth noises even when we try not to, and hopefully over time I will be able to make the players stop chewing on all of the equipment and hitting each other. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

Like many creatives, I was navigating the virtual and audio space during the pandemic. I had been in-talks with my Talent Managers at Bohemia Group to develop a full Audio Drama Series and have Philly Chick Pictures and I produce a project, while still quarantining, to keep me creatively inspired. I greatly appreciated Curt\u2019s writing talents and was impressed with his expertise in Sound Effects. Curt had pitched me a few fantastic storyline ideas, I fell in love with A Voice In Violet, and we began our production development process in the fall of 2021. We spent ample time fleshing out this series and assembling the necessary components. I was blessed to have Casting Director, Alison Buck, sign-on to help me cast our talented Actors (I had dreamed of!) Bronson Pinchot, Nikki Blonsky, and Nelson Lee (Thank you, Kat Seigworth!), then I had to have my talented friends and associates, Eric Etebari and Wilson Jermaine Heredia, onboard, as their roles were written for them, along with songs from my darling Diva Songstress Fawn, and score from the wild musical mind of Composer Michael Trapp. We truly assembled a dream cast, as well as keeping our commitment to diverse and inclusive character development and casting. As an Actress, I loved playing Violet so very much. Curt wrote this role perfectly for me and I had so much fulfillment finding the layers of this character throughout the audio series. I only hope the narrative audio podcast fans and listeners are entertained by A Voice In Violet.\" </em>- Brooke Lewis Bellas</p><p><em>\"It has been a thrill creating in the audio space, and with our talented cast who truly elevated the words off the page.
