Each week, Sarah unpacks a topic that affects our everyday health with the latest facts & research from well-respected experts in their field (academia, science, medicine, health).\n\nIt can be hard to sift through all the information we are bombarded with when it comes to health - especially when we don't know who to trust. We bring you experienced voices to cut through that noise of misinformation and give you the foundational knowledge you need to make up your own mind. Our goal is to breakdown complicated subjects into the philosophy of 'gentle changes': small steps we can take to create healthy and sustainable habits in the long-term!\n\nA former Assoc. Professor at the School of Health & Human Performance at Dublin City University, Sarah brings her passion & expertise to each conversation -  creating casual and easy-to-follow conversations with experts covering Gut Health; Pelvic Health; Menopause; Skincare; Chronic Disease; Heart Health and much more.\n\nNo More 'Taboo' Subjects!\nThe Natural Health Revolution wants to empower people to understand how to take care of their own bodies without embarrassment. Sarah and her guests lead by example with honest conversations about subjects we need to get comfortable with if we want to take care of ourselves and each other.",

Medical research has drastically changed our understanding of many G.I. diseases. Stomach ulcers are no known to be caused by an infection with H. pylori bacteria. So successful eradication of the infection prevents stomach ulcers from recurring. Bleeding ulcers and esophageal ulceration from acid reflux is rarely seen now with a very potent proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole. On the other hand autoimmune disease of the bowel such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis is on the increase although biologic agents are now able to alter the disease course so that the overall prognosis is better in these patients. Irritable bowel syndrome is more often diagnosed and its treatment leaves much to be desired. Screening colonoscopy has decreased the death rate from colon cancer. We also have a better understanding of anorectal disease and it's management. I am a professor of Medicine and have been practicing for over 30 years and offer my insights into our digestive wellbeing.",
