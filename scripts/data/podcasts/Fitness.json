        "description": "The answer to most digestive ailments today results from poor choices in our diet,  chronic stress and alterations in the microbiome or gut bacteria. Medical research has drastically changed our understanding of many G.I. diseases. Stomach ulcers are no known to be caused by an infection with H. pylori bacteria. So successful eradication of the infection prevents stomach ulcers from recurring. Bleeding ulcers and esophageal ulceration from acid reflux is rarely seen now with a very potent proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole. On the other hand autoimmune disease of the bowel such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis is on the increase although biologic agents are now able to alter the disease course so that the overall prognosis is better in these patients. Irritable bowel syndrome is more often diagnosed and its treatment leaves much to be desired. Screening colonoscopy has decreased the death rate from colon cancer. We also have a better understanding of anorectal disease and it's management. I am a professor of Medicine and have been practicing for over 30 years and offer my insights into our digestive wellbeing.",

        "description": "The Happychondriac Podcast is hosted by Husna Pasha.  It's a show about mental health and nothing is off the table to talk about. Husna has herself suffered with anxiety most of her life but has always managed to find away to a positive and happy life through humour and helping others as a way to combat some of those unwanted thoughts. \nHusna is an Occupational Therapist and Clinical Hypnotherapist who worked as the Lead in Mental Health in the Healthcare Sector.\nShe is a proud Aussie. Raised in Tasmania and embodies the true face of Australian life and culture- globally connected, female, educated, experienced and aspirational.\nShe started her own live on stage talk show in 2015 with the aim of empowering people through entertainment. It was the only show of its kind in Australia.  The show was very successful with a full house of 220 people in January and July 2017.\nFounder of The Happychondriac Society, she continues her mission of creating happier people through raising awareness around mental health through seminars, workshops and podcast.",

The focus of our episodes will be predominately based around good health practices, research studies/results, optimizing your health, self development, and how all of this ties into the current state of the American society! I will have many other fitness professionals and friends on to go through topics, discuss opinions, and help show us all that having a sit down conversation is the greatest fear of those looking to keep us divided.

We discover how the practice reached its present-day ubiquity and how it became embedded in powerful social currents shaping the world's future, such as feminism, digital media, celebrity culture, the stress pandemic and the quest for an authentic identity in the face of unprecedented change.Shearer's revealing history boasts a colorful cast of characters past and present, who tell an engaging tale of scholars and scandal, science and spirit, wisdom and waywardness.
