Do you know the story of the liquor that's in that glass? \"No,\" says the distiller, do you know how it got into the glass in the first place? Do you know what it takes? \"No,\" says the historian. And the rest is well...\n\nDistilled California is the distiller-driven podcast for the booze nerd. Join hosts Dylan Almendral and Ryan Freisen as we take a deep dive into the bottle. We discuss the history, legends, politics and future of the California distilling industry from the ground up and distill what it means to be grain to glass in California. Ryan is a distiller and Vice President of the California Artisanal Distillers Guild. Dylan is a historian and writer. Both are devout students and stewards of the glass. This show exists to create informed drinkers. If you drink, know what's in your bottle! And, of course, to document the California distillery world while it is in its infancy. \nThis podcast is for everyone; the aficionado, the vaguely interested, the distiller, the historian and the nerd alike. All are welcome and always will be. We all float down here. \n\nThe podcast will feature tastings, science, history, interviews with distillers, book reviews, distributors, and of course, good times. \n\nJoin us as we learn and pass on the experience to you! \n\nPlease LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE AND SUBSCRIBE\n",

Some of us are connoisseurs, some of us are newbies. Some of us want to reach expert status, some of us really don\u2019t care how the sausage, or seltzer, is made as long as it tastes good--but so we do want to know how and why a particular seltzer does indeed taste good.\n\nWTF Am I Drinking? is an explainer series that will dive into different topics like what a certain beer or wine style is, how a hard kombucha gets made, what the difference is between a stout and a porter--things like that. It\u2019s educational and informational but in the most fun way possible--consider it the perfect thing to do while you sip your favorite beverage. You\u2019ll learn a thing or two, and no doubt develop a deeper appreciation for drink X, Y, or Z. Basically, we all get to geek out a little, and dish on the beverages we love.",

        "description": "<p>Hillary Cole, Director of Sales at Bell Wine Cellars, discusses her passion for wine in general and specifically what sets Bell Wine Cellars apart. Hillary started out as a military linguist and counter-terrorism analyst in the Washington, DC area, during which time she also had the opportunity to visit vineyards in Italy fairly regularly. The serenity and romance of the vineyards were a stark contrast to her Intelligence career and she felt at home every time she stepped foot on one. After leaving the Intelligence field, she moved to Sacramento to learn how to fly fixed-wing aircraft. She intended to be here for two years and then to fly airlifts in Africa, but gravitated instead to the wine industry via restaurant management as the General Manager and Sommelier for three Sacramento-area restaurant groups after finishing her MBA studies and Intro Sommelier exam. Her final position on the restaurant side of wine was running the wine program at Ella Dining Room and Bar in Sacramento. Hillary has completed several wine certification programs, her favorites among which include French Wine Scholar, Champagne Master Level, Napa Valley Wine Expert, and The Business of Wine. She has loved having the opportunity to maximize her backgrounds in business, wine, and leadership via her position as Director of Sales Manager at Bell Wine Cellars.</p>",

Instead of waiting to find my community, I built my own to help others in the same situation. I provide you with valuable knowledge to make living life with Celiac Disease, an autoimmune disease, or simply eating gluten-free something you no longer see as a task. You deserve freedom from your diagnosis. Subscribe to find your freedom and to join the gluten-free community.

        "description": "Hi! My name\u2019s Harry, and welcome to Passing Through A Vegan Door Podcast. \n\nVeganism is a growing idea that leaving animals alone can save the world. It can be quite scary to take those first steps and change life long habits, but it\u2019s important to find a way to break those habits and understand that what we do to animals every day isn\u2019t right. \n\nPassing Through A Vegan Door is a way for me to talk about the things I care about while offering an insight into the who's, the what's, the when's, the where's, the why's, and the how's of being vegan. This podcast is for everyone: whether you\u2019ve got decades more experience than me in being vegan; or you just wish vegans would shut up and let you eat your steak in peace. I\u2019m not the expert\u2026 I\u2019m just here to pass on the word. Hopefully it can be somewhat entertaining as I do. \n\nI will cover a range of topics such as: the environment, society, health, politics, diet, the animals themselves, and more! I will be chatting to people who share a similar mindset, and a common goal of living a vegan lifestyle, but also people who couldn\u2019t care less. Those are the people who have the power to make real change. Small changes do make a big difference, and I hope to show you how.\n\n\u201cTo be vegan, is to release your grip on the animal\u201d\n\nThank you for reading, I hope whatever I can offer can be of help.

Join us on our journey.\n\nAs true natives of the Asheville NC area, the Howard family have raised generations in WNC. In 2012, they decided to start what was to become Asheville's first proper distillery to distill gin and rum since prohibition. With careful planning, research & development, and a burning desire to see Asheville become not just a beer mecca, but a craft beverage mecca, a distillery that would beckon curious drinkers far and wide was born.\nA vision to bring a craft spirit with class to the table would soon become reality.\nOver the years the vision has expanded to share the Cultivated Lifestyle. A new way to enjoy the distillery experience was created. From grain to garnish, Cultivated Cocktails takes you from the distillation process through the cocktail creation.",

Memphis truly reflects a commitment to an artisanal view of the food and drink crafted here. I have interviewed industry professionals and experts in their craft to get their perspectives on everything from gourmet coffee to fire stone beer to barbecue competition culture. I hope to share this with you. Memphis\u2019s culinary offerings are unique and unparallelled, offering a wide variety of artisanal products. Join me on a tour unpacking the art and science of the 901\u2019s food and drink culture, Memphis\u2019s best, the Mid-South Menu.\n\nMy goal with this podcast is for each episode to answer engaging questions you may have always had about the craft and creation of high-quality food and drink. Thus, at the beginning of each episode I\u2019ll name a few questions you can trust will be answered by the end.\n\nIntro Music: \"Past Sadness\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nOutro Music: \"Isolated\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",

It is a journey that is unique to each woman who embarks on it, yet it is also a shared experience that connects mothers across the world. Being a mother is a role that comes with great responsibility, sacrifice, and love. The moment a woman becomes a mother, her life changes forever. She is no longer just responsible for herself, but also for the life of her child. The bond between a mother</p><p>and her child is one of the strongest and most enduring relationships in the world. It is a connection that begins before birth and lasts a lifetime. A mother is the first person a child looks to for comfort, safety, and guidance. Motherhood is a journey that is filled with many challenges. From sleepless nights to the terrible twos, raising a child can be a rollercoaster of emotions. Mothers often have to juggle multiple roles, including being a caregiver, teacher, nurse, and friend. They have</p><p>to be patient, understanding, and compassionate, even when they are exhausted and frustrated. Despite the challenges, motherhood is also a journey that is filled with joy and love. The first smile, the first word, and the first steps are all milestones that fill a mother's heart with pride and happiness. Mothers have the opportunity to watch their children grow and develop into unique individuals with their own personalities and dreams. Motherhood is also a journey that is marked by sacrifice.</p><p>Mothers often put their own needs and desires aside to prioritize the needs of their children. They give up their time, energy, and resources to ensure that their children have everything they need to thrive. This selflessness is a testament to the depth of a mother's love. In conclusion, motherhood is a journey that is both beautiful and complex. It is a journey that is unique to each woman who embarks on it, yet it is also a shared experience that connects mothers across the world. Being a mother</p><p>is a role that comes with great responsibility, sacrifice, and love. It is a journey that is filled with challenges, but also with joy and love.</p>",

Do you ever wonder why certain recipes have been passed down in cultures and families for generations? Or why something as wonderful as a delicious dessert, can bring a sense of comfort, discovery, and bonding? Food provides sustenance for our bodies, but it's so much more than that.</strong></p><p><strong>Having lived in the Holy Land, I wanted to create this unique cookbook for the 2 million Christians whom, each year, perform pilgrimages to Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Jerusalem. There, they can celebrate the importance and joy of perpetuating and discovering the historical cultural rituals and traditions of cooking, baking, and eating. The recipes are not only delicious, but they also serve as a way to connect with one\u2019s Christian heritage and preserve a piece of our important history.</strong></p><p><strong>Through baking desserts and also learning about the spices, fruits, vegetables which are of major authenticity, we can learn about our ancestors, their traditions, and the stories behind the meals they enjoyed. Upon returning home from a journey to the Holy Land, pilgrims can also create new memories with loved ones by gathering in the kitchen and working together to create something special.</strong></p><p><strong>Throughout human history, food has the power to bring people closer together, to create a sense of community and belonging. Sharing a new dessert you've never tried baking before, is an experience that will be cherished.</strong></p><p><strong>So, come explore the cultural significance of desserts in the Holy Land, especially those enjoyed during the Easter and Christmas celebrations. Baking and eating the scrumptious goodies will bring joy, connection, and meaning to connecting with one\u2019s Christian hertiage.</strong></p><p><strong>To purchase a copy of each episode\u2019s recipe, stories, and photos, or, to purchase the entire book, Contact :  </strong><a href=\"mailto:Joeygalata@gmail.com\"><strong>Joeygalata@gmail.com</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>",

He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. \"What's happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. Drops</p>",

But in the face of these ongoing battles, we\u2019ll explore impactful solutions and meaningful pathways to profitability in order to keep producers on the land, to safeguard our private property rights, and to keep meat, dairy, and eggs on the dinner table.</p><p>And in stark contrast to the ugly, divisive headlines in today\u2019s mainstream media, \"The Heart of Rural America\" will celebrate the faith, family values, patriotism, and work ethic of the incredible people I meet in my travels as an agricultural speaker.

Canadians have grown accustomed to the chain's distinctive red and white logo and catchy jingles, and its Roll Up the Rim to Win promotion has grown to be a much-anticipated yearly event. The corporation has been able to solidify its reputation as a cherished Canadian institution because of the frequent inclusion of Canadian themes and cultural allusions in its marketing efforts.</p><p><strong>ABOUT WHY TIM HORTONS IS POPULAR?</strong></p><p>Tim Hortons is a well-known Canadian fast-food restaurant chain that primarily serves coffee and doughnuts, along with a variety of other food and beverage items. Here are some key points about Tim Hortons in Canada:</p><p><strong>Founding and History</strong>: Tim Hortons was founded in 1964 by Tim Horton, a former NHL hockey player, and Jim Charade. The first store opened in Hamilton, Ontario. The chain quickly grew in popularity and expanded across Canada.</p><p><strong>Iconic Products</strong>: Tim Hortons is famous for its coffee and doughnuts, especially its \"Timbits\" \u2013 bite-sized doughnut holes. Other popular items include breakfast sandwiches, bagels, muffins, and soups.</p><p><strong>Double-Double</strong>: One of the most well-known aspects of Tim Hortons is its coffee customization options. \"Double-double\" refers to a coffee with two creams and two sugars, but customers can order their coffee to specific preferences.</p><p><strong>Canadian Cultural Icon</strong>: Tim Hortons holds a special place in Canadian culture and is often considered a symbol of Canadian identity. It's a common meeting place for friends and family, and the brand is often associated with hockey and community gatherings.</p><p><strong>Expansion and International Presence</strong>: While Tim Hortons has a strong presence in Canada, it has also expanded internationally, including locations in the United States, the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. However, its identity as a Canadian icon has sometimes been a subject of debate, especially as the chain expanded beyond Canada.</p><p><strong>Ownership Changes</strong>: In 2014, Tim Hortons merged with Burger King to form the Restaurant Brands International (RBI) company. RBI is a Canadian multinational fast-food company that manages both the Tim Hortons and Burger King brands.</p><p><strong>Controversies and Challenges</strong>: Over the years, Tim Hortons has faced various controversies, including disputes with franchisees over issues like pricing, product quality, and revenue-sharing. These disputes have occasionally sparked public attention and debate.</p><p></p>",
