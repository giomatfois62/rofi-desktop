        "description": "This is show dedicated to those who belong in the space between - not quite fitting into each circle but instead the overlap. Covering topics from pop culture to politics to relationships, \"The Venn Diagram\" explores what it means to be part of a cultural dichotomy through the lens of those living this experience every day. I will cover topics including college, relationships, food, culture, current events, politics, music, and more (the brainstorming list continues). I will also feature guests that can speak to these topics and engage in honest conversations about their individual experiences. My guests will be students, professionals, and human beings alike that are apart of two different cultures (Asian, South Asian, Latinx, African American - BIPOC in general). I am excited to explore these topics and learn from our individual experiences to find the points of relatability and understanding.",

        "description": "Distilled California began as a joke. A historian and a distiller walk into a tasting room. What do they do? The historian says to the other. Do you know the story of the liquor that's in that glass? \"No,\" says the distiller, do you know how it got into the glass in the first place? Do you know what it takes? \"No,\" says the historian. And the rest is well...\n\nDistilled California is the distiller-driven podcast for the booze nerd. Join hosts Dylan Almendral and Ryan Freisen as we take a deep dive into the bottle. We discuss the history, legends, politics and future of the California distilling industry from the ground up and distill what it means to be grain to glass in California. Ryan is a distiller and Vice President of the California Artisanal Distillers Guild. Dylan is a historian and writer. Both are devout students and stewards of the glass. This show exists to create informed drinkers. If you drink, know what's in your bottle! And, of course, to document the California distillery world while it is in its infancy. \nThis podcast is for everyone; the aficionado, the vaguely interested, the distiller, the historian and the nerd alike. All are welcome and always will be. We all float down here. \n\nThe podcast will feature tastings, science, history, interviews with distillers, book reviews, distributors, and of course, good times. \n\nJoin us as we learn and pass on the experience to you! \n\nPlease LIKE, COMMENT, SHARE AND SUBSCRIBE\n",

Now, they want to improve their skills by creating a podcast that deep dives weekly into competitive Limited gameplay while also acknowledging the hilarity of the MTG grind. \n\nDusk//Dawn is a conversational podcast which leverages both Josh and Alex's obsessions to continually explore the inner workings of modern limited Magic. As a secondary goal, it's also self-aware of the fact that the hosts still don't have perfect knowledge of how to play the game. Strategy, commentary, game design criticisms, bad heuristics, and comedy are all fair game while talking. For those obsessed with Magic commentary like Josh and Alex, Dusk//Dawn is the chaser for the more analytical and technical Magic podcasts about Limited.\n\nExplicit Content -- Swearing\nIntro and outro song courtesy of the Free Music Archive\nJesse Spillane - Sinking Feeling\nJesse Spillane - Number 0",

Our podcast is unique compared to all others due to the fact that we are real brothers. We both started our whiskey discoveries about seven years ago. We have travelled the world together exploring all things whiskey. We hope to provide you with some great stories, make you laugh a lot, learn some and just enjoy honest conversation about the worlds best brown liquid. We are novices when it comes to whiskey and by no means do we know all there is to know about whiskey, but we love where the journey has taken us so far and hope you will join us on this podcast endeavor. We will be sharing stories along our journeys, updating listeners with up to date news/notes, pitting two whiskeys against each other in the Whiskey Standoff, and testing each others (and yours) whiskey knowledge in Stump the Bro. Searching for Pappy is a segment in which we discuss our recent whiskey purchases, while searching for Pappy Van Winkle at MSRP (don't laugh). What's the Juice segment is our version of blind taste testing. Whiskey in 60 (W60) is a segment where we give you all the information we feel is relevant and important for a specific whiskey bottle. At the end of the 60 second review we give our opinion, on whether you should buy it, shortlist it or avoid it.</p><p>Please follow us on YouTube at The Real Bourbon Bros Podcast, Facebook by searching for Bourbon Bros Gary Steve, Tik Tok@therealbourbonbros, Twitter @realbourbonbros, Instagram by searching for therealbourbonbros and email us at bourbonandbros@gmail.com Thank you for giving us a listen, please feel free to contact us and leave us a comment.

As current UK champion, tournament organiser and once described as the UK\u2019s version of LJ Pena, what this man doesn\u2019t know about Legion isn\u2019t worth knowing. Expect expert tactical advice and insightful takes as this man will help you level up your game.\n\nOur second commentator is Olly Dier (CBT3 on discord), another man well known in the UK scene and is usually found in the top cuts at major events most recently with an obscene OP Luke with Rebel DLT troopers in support.\n\nLastly the unenviable task hosting and keeping the show on track is Cockles Faulkner (aka CocklesFaulkner on discord). Cockles will often be found at UK legion events, admittedly more southern based events but when he is not playing Legion he can often be found in a Karaoke bar or sat at home still dreaming of knowing what a top cut is.\n\nYou may wish to contact us and can do so by emailing Thatsnomoonpod@googlemail.com\n\nYou can also follow us on Instagram @thatsnomoonpodcast or like our Facebook Page \u201cThat\u2019s No Moon: A Star Wars Legion Podcast\u201d.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you and providing you with some great SWL content!\nMay the force be with us!

She spent her summers walking barefoot through old cotton mills and peeping over her pawpaw\u2019s shoulder as he made moonshine in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.</p><p>Charlee knew at a young age that she had no desire to follow in the isolated footsteps of everyone in the deep South, especially those living in her sleepy town. She was born with ambition, determination, vitality, discipline and, above all, the natural looks and personality that set her apart from most of the world.</p><p>Trying to break away from the label of garbage can poor, Charlee\u2019s charisma was inherent in her personality; however, her biggest fear was remaining on a route of strife and impoverishment. Due to this overwhelming fear, she grew up obsessed with the idea of opulence and finding ways to position herself among the social elite.</p><p>Charlee Rae\u2019s targets were easily fooled by her charming character, which hid a cunning villainy. Charlee became the master of her fate, controlling people and circumstances that manufactured her dark side.</p><p>Charlee schooled herself on the established traits of being a master manipulator. She was uninhibited and iniquitous in using her appeal to lure in any man of her choice. However, these men always had one thing in common--money. Her endless games of trickery and implausible convictions fueled a thrilling rush but pushed her into a world of immorality.</p><p>Witness as Charlee Rae masters her craft of seduction to control the world\u2019s richest and most powerful men. Fade into the emotional struggles of her upbringing that paved the path of her methodical thinking. Take a front-row seat to learn the bona fide secrets and wretchedness clung onto the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me. At what price would you sell your soul or commodify your body to the illusion of the haut monde? Suppose you were Charlee Rae, would you make the same risky decisions?

Each episode of History On The Go runs roughly for an hour and forty-five minutes, covering two topics per session: One more narrow topic specifically related in some way to the American Civil War, and one broader topic relating to anything regarding general history, be it North American History or World History. History On The Go is dedicated to preserving a fun and respectful round-table discussion, where no one is ostracized for a lack of knowledge or opinion, and where all topics can be discussed fairly, reasonably, and openly. Whilst History On The Go will likely cover some less friendly and kind topics, all history is important to remember and discuss - if we cannot learn from the mistakes and trouble of the past, we cannot help the future to be better. Disclaimers will be provided before any topics we feel particularly troubling, and we are always open to comments, concerns, and what-have-you from any of our listeners.

I will have my eccentric thoughts of what the modern car community has to offer. At times I will seem unreasonable, ill-informed, or perhaps even uncouth when it comes to my topics of discussion, but I hope it sparks those independent thinkers in \"the scene\" to challenge me or themselves to the \"what\" and \"why.\" </p><p>Thank you to those who have followed my Youtube Channel @yourrideandi and I hope to offer you another outlet of pessimistic, yet appreciative enthusiasm for the automotive gear-heads. </p><p>Follow my YouTube channel: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@YourRideandI/featured\">https://www.youtube.com/@YourRideandI/featured</a></p>",

Since not all of us had the birds and the bees talk here we have a segment where we do get that intimate with our bodies and the things it goes through and have a open space to talk about it all. We also have the pleasure of being joined by some cool people who bring in new stories and perspectives. Here we are all friends just vibing and nothing should be taken serious being this is for entertainment. I make jokes some might think are mean or rude but once you get to know me you\u2019ll see I\u2019m just a humble \u201cbad\u201d mouth. The reason I have this pod is to make you feel like its not just you and let you know I will be that one person you know will never judge you and will always try to be there for you.
