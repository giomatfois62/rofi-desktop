Here, I and those who appear on this podcast throw all titles, all skin colour, everything away, and focus on the least focused on part of life; Genuine conversation. Like the groups of older generations meeting at your local coffee shop, having a calm debate between two humans of different backgrounds\u2026 different upbringings\u2026 different perspectives. \nNow, for me \u201cMix\u201d, I\u2019m just an idiot, only trying to make it through life, one day better then the last one, one day at a time. I\u2019m a Millennial, not by choice, but because I\u2019m swept into that pile. I come from a cadet background (Royal Canadian Air Cadets), and I DO NOT back down to those who challenge my views/beliefs. BUT, I am just a licensed bodyman from Canada, with possibly some mental disconnections. Honestly, just a nobody that has surprised himself as to how he has gotten this far in his life, when people used to tell him the clich\u00e9 terms like you\u2019re \u201cno good\u201d, \u201cworthless\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cweirdo\u201d; that you\u2019re just stupid and will not succeed. Battling himself, trying to find the \u201cmeaning of life\u201d. If you\u2019re like me, you often find yourself alone, asking. \u201dWhat is the correct way to think/interact? Why are humans here? How did we come to be? What is the REAL TRUTH? Is it Science, Is it Religion? Where are we going? Who will lead us? Who will lead us humans to greatness? But, aren\u2019t we all just that? Human. So why not come along for the ride, be human, come join my discussion circle, have a coffee or tea, and let\u2019s talk; Shall we?\nSome of you, are probably asking, but WHO is this guy? For privacy reasons, I wish for my identity to stay private. I do not wish for fame. YES I DO NOT WISH FOR FAME. I don\u2019t wish to be worldwide know. I just want people to LISTEN TO THE PODCAST. I am merely just using this platform as all AMAZING podcasters do (on this amazing service), Just as a meeting point, to discuss views and have a good discussion, to take a step back from life (stop to smell the roses), just relax, have a conversation about whatever comes to mind and not have to worry about \"Nae-Sayers\". Focus on genuine conversation between two humans. \n",

The Degen Report is planning on being the launching pad! We will also be releasing YouTube videos, that lean more towards the comedic side of Cardano. These will consist of everything from Clips from the podcast, to doing Cardano based tier lists\nWe also plan on doing livestreams!

Join me on On Brand Brides where I talk to brides and grooms about their special day (or in my case, days). Every person is unique, and our weddings should be too! Not just another planning advice podcast, episodes highlight stories about the weddings and the couples themselves. What wedding doesn\u2019t have good stories, and I want to hear all the details - the good, the bad, and especially the ugly. Laugh, cry, and laugh until you cry with me and my guests as we relive our weddings. Expect to hear from guests with different perspectives, bringing their unique personalities to the show. Weddings shouldn't be one-size-fits-all. Who do you relate to the most? Tune in to find out! Episodes released every other Wednesdays (usually). Follow on instagram @onbrandbrides </p>",

        "description": "<p>After a looonnnggg hiatus, Wylde Style Radio \u201cUnreal Radio\u201d is BACK and has their own Network now! Featuring Stand Up &amp; Shout, Notebook Wagering, Tribe Called Jess, Welcome to Manassas (A Classy Variety Show) and more WYLDE shows to come, WSN will bring the fun back to our \u201cunreal\" network\u2026also known as streaming and/or podcasting. We will also be looking to add other fun shows to add to the Wylde Style Network. Contact us if you think you\u2019ve got what it takes to be a show on the Wylde Style Network. Wylde Style Radio got started in 2007 as an add-on to the Wylde Style brand when owner, Jeff Wylde, got together with his good friends Kevin Shafer and Rocky Parrish to form Wylde Style Radio w/ Kevin &amp; Rock. The goal was to get the show on terrestrial radio as \u201cGuy Talk\u201d was what was hot at the time. The problem was, they had no idea how to do that other than trying to work connections and put a demo together. So, after working all their contacts and bringing on AV expert, John Caniford, to try something new at the time called live streaming and podcasting, Wylde Style Radio w/ Kevin &amp; Rock launched it\u2019s first show from studios they built inside of the now defunct Chics-N-Wings. The show was a pioneer in podcasting and streaming as even the major stations hadn\u2019t started doing it at the time. The show was instantly popular but a little to bawdy for management at Chics-N-Wings so they had to rethink their strategy and decided to take the show on the road\u2026in a pink RV. At that time Wylde Style Productions had a pink \u201cparty bus\u201d RV for its events. WSR moved into the \u201cPink Nightmare\u201d and we took the show to the masses, doing live shows from outside of popular local bars and businesses like Hooters, The Rhino, PJ Skiddoos, Good Times Tattoos and more. WSR continued to build their audience until 2009 when Kevin &amp; Rock got the call up to the big leagues, 106.7 The Fan DC. They continued to do their show on various platforms until 2016 when everyone went their separate ways until now, when we decided to \u201cget the band back together\u201d as they say. Now we've evolved into our own network with other \"Wylde\" shows to boot!</p>",

        "description": "<p>Testing the limits of artificial intelligence by chatting to the artificially intelligent. It's an entirely new sort of podcast. An artificial presenter talks to artificial chatbots. Why? In order to establish the boundary that separates human from machine intelligence. It's funny. It's thought provoking. It dramatises what chatbots can and cannot do. It's a revelation! The sudden popularity of artificial intelligence programs has created a massive use of Chatbots to do all sorts of tasks from writing school and university essays to generating computer code. It\u2019s said that in America a chatbot has passed the American bar exam. (Bear in mind, that may just be a rumour put about by chatbots. Which in itself may be even more alarming if they\u2019re starting to manage their own reputations.) In any event, white collar professionals believe their jobs are about to be taken over by machines. This podcast may be reassuring in one way. Because we see that chatbots can make complete idiots of themselves. But it's also true that . . . THEY'RE COMING! Don\u2019t believe me? Don\u2019t want to believe me? Can\u2019t believe they\u2019re really that good? Let's talk to them and find out!</p>",

        "description": "My name is David Collins. I am a Radio DJ and Broadcaster from Manhattan, Kansas. I've been doing Radio since I was 18. First starting in college (shout out KSDB), I quickly realized this was something I was pretty good at. Since then, I've worked with a variety of radio stations, finally landing at K-Rock 101.5. There, I was able to meet and speak with many famous and/or interesting people. Although it was a great opportunity, at the time, fortunately for me, times change. I've been cut loose from the chains of day-time Radio, and have a new show. David Collins 30 Minute Half Hour Show is a great opportunity to interview new guests, talk new topics, and get little more edgy than what my audience may be used to. I'm happy to have some of my old listeners, and bring my voice to a new audience. Contact DC30minutehalfhour@gmail.com and you may have your voicemail played on the show! Thanks for watching!",

This epic trilogy is constantly misunderstanding each other and causing confusion amongst themselves. This chaotic trio discuss out of the ordinary topics and share embarrassing experiences that normal people would take to their grave. Despite the generational gap between the three, they somehow hilariously balance one another out. They have a knack for making people extremely uncomfortable with their unusually dark sense of humor.
