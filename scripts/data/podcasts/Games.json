From the first toy soldier they ever picked up, to their most current projects, and plenty of amazing things in between. This podcast is intended to accompany you as you sit down to hobby yourself, and provide a glimpse into the histories of gamers and painters, new and old. \n\nMy name is John and I've been running the hobby blog heresyandheroes.com for almost a decade now, and I've met so many amazing painters and gamers, that I thought I'd try putting together a podcast where I can introduce you to these talented individuals and get into why they love the hobby, and what keeps them going. There's a page on the blog featuring more details on each guest, and I'll be running seasons of 10-12 episodes with short breaks between seasons. \n\nYou can follow me on twitter at @Heresyheroes to keep up with the latest news about the show, and I encourage you to follow each of my guests too.",

Oh no. Our sessions are filled with laughter, jokes and plenty of messing about. We don't get too serious, and we're not afraid to get drunk every once in a while.</p><p>Each season, we'll be taking you on a journey through a different TTRPG. From Dungeons &amp; Dragons to Call of Cthulhu and many more each season, we're always up for trying something new. And along the way, we'll be sharing our thoughts, experiences, and of course, plenty of laughs.</p><p>So sit down, chill out, and join us for a little TTRPG fun. You never know what will happen, but one thing is for sure - it's always a great time with our group.</p><p>This podcast contains adult language and themes</p>",

Millions of people find joy in the experiences that these games create, but what else do we get from playing them? \n\nIn this podcast, Steve Gotzler and Jordan Tynes explore the world of tabletop games with people who possess a deep understanding of the various themes, settings, systems, or content that we encounter in them. What does an economist think about while playing Monopoly? What about a quilter sitting down for a round of Patchwork? A planetary geologist and Terraforming Mars? Or a farmer and Agricola? \n\nSteve, Jordan, and their guests consider how games communicate information about the variety of subjects they take up. They also ask how games can influence players\u2019 feelings about each other, and the world that they inhabit. From the physical components strewn about the table, to the rules we share while playing, sit down for a round of playful discussion about the cultural relevance of tabletop gaming.\n",

Expect unit reviews, battle reports and general Star Wars Legion chit chat from a UK and European perspective. \n\nThat\u2019s No Moon features three of the UK\u2019s most known players in the UK Star Wars Legion scene.\n\nAndy Terrell, also known as AJST on discord is \u201cpundit\u201d number one. As current UK champion, tournament organiser and once described as the UK\u2019s version of LJ Pena, what this man doesn\u2019t know about Legion isn\u2019t worth knowing. Expect expert tactical advice and insightful takes as this man will help you level up your game.\n\nOur second commentator is Olly Dier (CBT3 on discord), another man well known in the UK scene and is usually found in the top cuts at major events most recently with an obscene OP Luke with Rebel DLT troopers in support.\n\nLastly the unenviable task hosting and keeping the show on track is Cockles Faulkner (aka CocklesFaulkner on discord). Cockles will often be found at UK legion events, admittedly more southern based events but when he is not playing Legion he can often be found in a Karaoke bar or sat at home still dreaming of knowing what a top cut is.\n\nYou may wish to contact us and can do so by emailing Thatsnomoonpod@googlemail.com\n\nYou can also follow us on Instagram @thatsnomoonpodcast or like our Facebook Page \u201cThat\u2019s No Moon: A Star Wars Legion Podcast\u201d.\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you and providing you with some great SWL content!\nMay the force be with us!
