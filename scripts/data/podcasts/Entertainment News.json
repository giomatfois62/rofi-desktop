And when shit gets tough and difficult situations arise, we\u2019re ready to help you get through them. What started as a self-deprecating phrase we coined from personal frustration, nobuddies yet quickly turned into a passionate idea and concept we thought a lot of twenty-something year olds, and younger, could relate to. We know the anxiety associated with feeling like you don\u2019t have your life all figured out. Sometimes you need a little reminder from the people around you to just relax and that it will truly all work out how it\u2019s supposed to. Oh yeah, and it\u2019s more fun to go through it all with some of your closest friends, or should we say, buddies. ",

Join Blake & Kaleb every Sunday to talk about everything from heinous serial killers to UFOs.  We are in no way, shape, or form psychologists, forensic experts, or investigators of any sorts.  We are simply just weirdos that like the obscure.  These stories are meant to intrigue and possibly compel people to do their own research and look into the subjects further.  We hope you enjoy our take on the subject matter.  \n\n***You may hear the podcast referred to as The Nightmare on 6th St. in the first couple of episodes.  The correct title of the podcast is Sunday Underground.***",

It\u2019s just that I have passion for a lot of things. By day, I\u2019m a real estate investor, working hard to break a generational curse of financial instability while building a wealth legacy. I also enjoy coaching others to do the same, as that is my call to service, amongst other things. Thanks to my daddy, I\u2019m naturally gifted with my hands so I love to busy myself with DIY projects. With 23 years of broadcast radio experience, it\u2019s inherent for me stay abreast of the latest news, entertainment, lifestyle and politics. Not to mention, I'm a wife, mother, sister, auntie, and friend.

Qui ho voluto creare degli audio estemporanei senza che vi fosse un bench\u00e8 minimo ritocco audio, semplicemente anche un filtro per togliere eventuali riverberi della stanza. Tutto in presa diretta, naturale e spontaneo. La novit\u00e0 sta tutta qui, registrer\u00f2 questi audio esclusivamente con il cellulare, quindi la qualit\u00e0 sar\u00e0 quella che sar\u00e0, buona, ottima, pessima. Dipender\u00e0 dal momento in cui registro e dall'ambiente in cui registro. Il podcast, per quanto io lo concepisca come un prodotto non perfettamente confezionato (come lo sono invece la maggiorparte), tutt'altro, lo interpreto come qualcosa di estremamente spontaneo e non cuarto, come ho sempre dichiarato fin dall'esordio de Il piano sottile. Il podcast \u00e8 comunque un prodotto vecchio, come i prodotti che le prime radio rilasciavano nei primi decenni della loro esistenza, sono tutti postprodotti e raramente si trovano episodi LIVE in ambienti che non siano una studio radiofocnico o un ambiente acusticamente trattato. Qui invece voglio andare oltre il podcast, che appunto nasce vecchio, qui registrer\u00f2 solamente pensieri estemporanei in libert\u00e0, ma senza ritocco alcuno. La piattaforma (provvisoria credo) che ho scelto \u00e8 Soundcloud, perch\u00e8 comunque mi garantisce una certa libert\u00e0 nell'embedding delle tracce pubblicate, anche se lo spazio \u00e8 purtroppo limitato. Il mio intento era quello di sfruttare il mio canale Telegram dove pubblicare gli audio e poi incorporarli nel sito, ma sembra al momento che ancora non sia possibile. Accetto critiche e suggerimenti. Buon ascolto.\n",

        "description": "<p>After a looonnnggg hiatus, Wylde Style Radio \u201cUnreal Radio\u201d is BACK and has their own Network now! Featuring Stand Up &amp; Shout, Notebook Wagering, Tribe Called Jess, Welcome to Manassas (A Classy Variety Show) and more WYLDE shows to come, WSN will bring the fun back to our \u201cunreal\" network\u2026also known as streaming and/or podcasting. We will also be looking to add other fun shows to add to the Wylde Style Network. Contact us if you think you\u2019ve got what it takes to be a show on the Wylde Style Network. Wylde Style Radio got started in 2007 as an add-on to the Wylde Style brand when owner, Jeff Wylde, got together with his good friends Kevin Shafer and Rocky Parrish to form Wylde Style Radio w/ Kevin &amp; Rock. The goal was to get the show on terrestrial radio as \u201cGuy Talk\u201d was what was hot at the time. The problem was, they had no idea how to do that other than trying to work connections and put a demo together. So, after working all their contacts and bringing on AV expert, John Caniford, to try something new at the time called live streaming and podcasting, Wylde Style Radio w/ Kevin &amp; Rock launched it\u2019s first show from studios they built inside of the now defunct Chics-N-Wings. The show was a pioneer in podcasting and streaming as even the major stations hadn\u2019t started doing it at the time. The show was instantly popular but a little to bawdy for management at Chics-N-Wings so they had to rethink their strategy and decided to take the show on the road\u2026in a pink RV. At that time Wylde Style Productions had a pink \u201cparty bus\u201d RV for its events. WSR moved into the \u201cPink Nightmare\u201d and we took the show to the masses, doing live shows from outside of popular local bars and businesses like Hooters, The Rhino, PJ Skiddoos, Good Times Tattoos and more. WSR continued to build their audience until 2009 when Kevin &amp; Rock got the call up to the big leagues, 106.7 The Fan DC. They continued to do their show on various platforms until 2016 when everyone went their separate ways until now, when we decided to \u201cget the band back together\u201d as they say. Now we've evolved into our own network with other \"Wylde\" shows to boot!</p>",

Since not all of us had the birds and the bees talk here we have a segment where we do get that intimate with our bodies and the things it goes through and have a open space to talk about it all. We also have the pleasure of being joined by some cool people who bring in new stories and perspectives. Here we are all friends just vibing and nothing should be taken serious being this is for entertainment. I make jokes some might think are mean or rude but once you get to know me you\u2019ll see I\u2019m just a humble \u201cbad\u201d mouth.
