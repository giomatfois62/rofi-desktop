Because It's Always About Gender, we have no shame in viewing it all through a feminist lens, but have no fear - there are lots of laughs along the way. Of course, we also enjoy chatting about fashion, makeup, and playing a good game of FMK...but hey, no one's perfect, right?  ",

Medicine and technology have all progressed abundantly, and the world itself has been turned into one great city, governed and managed by the Governmental-Company Alliance, or the GCA. \n\nThese particular recordings concern the discovery of a peculiar machine. When two very different people find themselves bound by the fate of one mysterious bot, life in the World-City begins to change...\nA more detailed trigger warning can be found with each written chapter on the main site. As a general rule of thumb, this story should be considered content for mature audiences. Violence is abundant throughout the world of Thousel, and multiple characters regularly deal with very real mental health struggles that could be triggering for readers. There will be graphic language (both fictional and real-world) and descriptions of altogether not-very-happy scenes.\n\nInterface is a webnovel written by iwriterobots.

Through a complex licensure system, they decree which spells and arcane artifice are permissible for public, \u201casfalis\u201d use.\n\nArroyo, The City of Bridges and Roses, is a suburb of Los Angeles that seems like it crawled out of a storybook. Five palatial terraces of land are connected by a myriad of bridges over gulches where the brambles of a colossal, petrified rose briar reside. But this seemingly-tranquil city seethes with dark secrets and otherworldly threats amass in its shadows.\n\nSevardin Harker, a newly minted member of the Amagium\u2019s Peacekeeping Force, is thrust into the deep end on his second day on the job, when he has a life-threatening encounter with a form of magic most people believe to be fiction.\n\nMeanwhile, Hace Matthews and Alinore Valmont, two precocious aspiring peacekeepers, begin their 11-year matriculation at Arroyo\u2019s Athenaeum, the Amagium\u2019s rigorous training ground...\n---\n\nFor more episodes, references, and other information, please visit AnnoAmagium.com.

On our weekly podcast episodes we bring you comics of the week, nerdy news &amp;  celebrity gossip, Movie trailers, inside information on coming events and TV show reviews . We don't always agree with each other, and that's usually where the conversation gets INTERESTING!! . Tune in every Thursdays at 8:00 PM Eastern to have some fun, talk some ish and hear what we think about the status of the nerd multiverse! -- oh and bring a drink!! </p>",
