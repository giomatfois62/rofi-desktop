Before COVID, our team which consists of RN\u2019s CNA\u2019s and psychosocial supports are field based healthcare workers and would pop in and out of the office during the day. After COVID, in an effort to reduce the spread, our doors have been closed to field staff, corporate leadership has been grounded from traveling to our offices and we needed a way to keep everyone motivated, engaged and connected. We have always started our day with a 15 minute morning team call, its primary purpose was to inform the team of any patient needs. After COVID, we needed to rethink how we have always done things and reinvent the utility of the morning call. We emerged with a call that provided motivation, support, encouragement, critical COVID updates, patient need updates, employee and team engagement, and strong leadership to help everyone see their way through this Global Crisis. What we happened upon was magic! For a team that pretty much turned over 75% in the early months of COVID, mainly due to personal circumstances, we needed to form and norm a team virtually. We would say we not only accomplished that goal, but THRIVED into one of the best, most cohesive teams we have ever been a part of. This podcast is about how we do it...",

While the discussion and promotion of STEM fields is the main focus of the show, Art plays a key role as well. The Art portion of the show discusses various manners and how it relates to STEM. Full STEAM Ahead promotes careers in the STEAM field and serves as an outlet for professionals looking for inspirational interviews.\n\nThe goal of the podcast is to uplift African Americans and people of color in the fields listed above. While tons of money each year are donated to STEAM fields by companies, celebrities, athletes, influencers, etc., the world only gets to see small clips of these interactions. On one end of the spectrum, there are several radio shows and podcasts that focus on at least one, if not all of the following: pop culture, hip-hop culture, politics, or sports. Completely opposite of this, there are podcasts and radio shows that discuss: academia, heavily technical topics, and STEM. Full STEAM Ahead aims to have a little bit of both.\n\nStarring James aka J Linz, Allante aka LL, Brill, Diggs, Dr. Shar and Taylor D. The show consists of three segments and a main topic or interview. Segments include LITT (Lessons In The Trap), Nature Vs. Nurture and Blowing Off Some STEAM.

Here we share tactics and strategies each week to help business professionals targeting multiple 6 Figures navigate this current job market so that they can land the job they deserve! Whether you need help with your branding, getting on more interviews, converting interviews to offers, maximizing your compensation, or mindset clarity, this podcast is for you! Tim Madden is the Founder of Executive Career Upgrades and is a Veteran Headhunter who has led teams that have sold and fulfilled on over 50 million dollars in Staffing and Recruitment services since 2013 and has helped place over 6,000 business professionals. Prior to that, he was one of the top recruiters for the military and went on to become an Army Field Artillery Officer. He has seen tens of thousands of resumes (probably more) and interacted with CEOs and Senior Executives at some of the top companies in the world. And, he is a frequent contributor to <a href=\"http://Entrepreneur.com\">Entrepreneur.com</a>, Fast Company, Forbes, &amp; Newsweek and sits on the council of various organizations.</p><p>Your co-host, Kristina Madden, co-founder and Chief People Officer of Executive Career Upgrades, is a Mindset Expert who has worked with top Executives to develop their mindset, helping them to reframe their state of mind to achieve success and reach their true potential. Kristina has consulted for some of the fastest-growing companies on the Inc. 500 list.</p><p>Resumes almost never clearly describe someone\u2019s own \u201ctrue skills and achievements,\u201d most of the time, hiring managers want to focus on specific bullet points in a job description. This isn\u2019t something that is new; this is a challenge candidates and hiring managers have had going on for years. Also, most people are confused in their career. They don\u2019t know what to target, they don\u2019t know how to build a clear impactful message, and most of the time settle for mediocrity which leads to poor job performance, low pay, and unfulfillment. Not only do Tim and Kristina Madden attract high-quality candidates for companies, but they are also passionate about helping high achievers land that next multiple 6-figure job, which most of the time is less about tactics and more about mindset and confidence.</p>",

It is designed for students drawn to study the humanities in college who might be concerned about what that might mean for their career. It's also for those who advise such students, whether as parents or professionals. The stories in this podcast debunk widespread misperceptions about humanities majors\u2019 career prospects by highlighting some of the limitless possibilities for applying humanities knowledge and skills in today\u2019s workforce. Season 1 features a diverse group of young professionals with humanities backgrounds working in a variety of industries. Season 2 features 8 stories about diverse professionals with humanities backgrounds who not only do well for themselves but do good for the world. Focusing on one individual per episode, the podcast invites listeners to learn what motivated them to study the humanities and how they built a successful and fulfilling career using the knowledge and skills they gained through those studies. In this way, the podcast traces pathways from undergraduate humanities majors to careers in law, medicine, public health, finance, technology, social enterprise, museums, public relations, philanthropy, podcasting, filmmaking, and high-end food production. Each episode is also framed around a broader theme that applies to humanities career pathways across career fields and disciplines.

The creators of the 2152 Project, Mike Hassler (Utah) and Jason Van Nus (Georgia), live 2,152 miles apart, where the name for the 2152 Project emerged. They are both considered thought-leaders in the Work-Based Learning space.\n\nThe genesis for their vision of the 2152 project began when Jason met Mike at a conference. During introductions, a dialogue ensued where each realized that they were being contacted by states, schools, WBL professionals, and businesses across the country to address issues emerging within the Work-Based Learning community. As a result of this dialogue, The 2152 Project emerged to take these private, siloed conversations into the public forum, hoping to create more robust WBL Programs that better serve our students, communities, and industries.\n",

Their college just announced it is about to close - for good.   \n\nHow do you avoid this story happening to you?\n\nMany private colleges have recently closed and it is likely many more will close.  \n\nOur College Viability App shows which ones are more likely to do so.   Don't let your student choose a financially unhealthy college and lose lost credits, lost time and lost money if it closes.  We have done all the work to let you compare the financial health of these colleges and choose one that will have the resources to provide your student with a solid education.\n\nAs a former college administrator, I have seen first-hand the financial challenges that too many private colleges face and have chosen not to share with you.\n\nThe College Viability App enables students, parents, leaders and others to compare the changes in a private colleges\u2019 finances, enrollment, and outcomes over a recent period of 6 years.\n\nFor families this information lets them make more informed decisions about their college choice -- limiting the risk choosing a one whose financial results suggest viability concerns in the coming months and years.\n\nFor higher education leaders, the App provides comparative data about competitors and potential merger or alliance partners.\n\nHere is a YouTube link showing how to use the College Viability App.  https://bit.ly/3jGXA9t\n\nHere is the full College Viability YouTube channel.   See if a college you are considering is reviewed for financial health and viability.    https://bit.ly/3DLq7mr\n\nIf you want to get updates to your inbox, go to   https://www.collegeviability.com/institute-lead-magnetj5cyzcmf \n\nAt CollegeViability.com, we have also developed a curated site about private colleges and higher education.

As I said, straight talking and authentic.\n\nAs I am still a registered Real Estate Agent (Licensee) I will also host solo shows where I talk about anything interesting in the industry and also share some recruitment tips and tricks if you are on the hunt for new per'sonnel' or on the hunt for a new job.\n\n\"Powered by sonnel Recruitment - Your per'sonnel' partner\".\n\nConnect or follow at \n- https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicdirosso/\n- hello@sonnelrecruitment.com.au\n- https://sonnelrecruitment.com.au/ \n- https://www.linkedin.com/company/sonnel-recruitment\n- https://www.youtube.com/@insidetheleadershipcryptex",

Invaluable offers a holistic framework to aid its discovery, testing and succinct communication. This homage to values is brought out through stories, philosophy, poetry, citizen science and embedded podcasts. By the end of this book, you will have a deeper understanding of your singular values blueprint, making intentional decision-making an enriching process.
