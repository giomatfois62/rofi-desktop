        "description": "Though veterans of the United States of America liberated others worldwide at immense sacrifice, a little told American story is the unique liberation of the Tuscan people by the Buffalo Soldiers of WWII. After the War ended, these courageous men were sent home to a 'Jim Crow' America. \n\nItalian history is strikingly different. The impoverished, starving Tuscans feel as if they owe their lives to the Buffalo Soldiers, whom they lovingly dubbed 'Giganti Buoni' (Good Giants). An Italian eyewitness said, \u201cThey came down the mountain and freed us, and took care of us.\u201d \n\nIvan J. Houston, who was himself wounded in WWII, served in the Segregated 92nd Infantry Division, which bravely fought and pushed the German Nazis and Italian Fascists back behind  The Gothic Line. Tragically, these \"Black Warriors\" were also forced to fight the U.S. Army\u2019s institutionalized racism, and even individual racist White officers who did not want them to succeed.\n\n\u201cThat was just the way the Army was,\u201d says Mr. Houston, retired CEO of America\u2019s third largest African American-owned corporation. \n\nBetween 1945 and 2011, Mr. Houston returned many times to Italy, meeting the Pope, revisiting his battlefields of old, and honoring his fallen comrades at the Florence-American Cemetery. Then, after writing the book, \"Black Warriors: The Buffalo Soldiers of WWII, with Gordon Cohn, Mr. Houston was introduced by chance to many, many Italian Reenactors who treated him with warmth and respect. Through the hospitality of a gracious Italian woman, Mattea Piazzesi, a unique bond was formed between two families, the Houston's and the Piazzesi's. Ms Piazzesi had discovered Mr. Houston via his book.\n\nMr. Houston investigated missing casualty records with the help of local historians, who found the culprit was General Edward Almond, the racist commander (a fact acknowledged by the U.S. War College), who sent an African American Regiment into deadly battle without warning them to expect a heavy Nazi attack. This caused heavy casualties, which Almond then covered up. \n\nThe documentary film, \"With One Tied Hand\" tells the stirring story of how Tuscan gratitude is finally shown to Mr. Houston, who on behalf of all Buffalo Soldiers is paraded and celebrated on a loving, yearly reenactment of the Liberation of Lucca, the 500-year-old walled city. The film also reveals moving personal stories from surviving eyewitnesses and their families. \n\n\u201cI think this is the only instance in history where African-Americans have liberated another people,\u201d Mr. Houston concludes.",

The goal is to hopefully help someone, anyone, who desires more out of this life. Wispit is not a medical forum, but more of an encapsulation of  the experiences and words of wisdom of many people, some of whom are colleagues and friends, as a time capsule.   In this journey, I will interview people of various ages, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Although this podcast is designed by a woman, it is not limited simply to women.  It is my hope that anyone, and everyone who tunes in, will be enriched, edified, spiritually touched, and moved to bypass the challenges of life,  and rise from the ashes of this limited existence to a higher elevation of thinking and creativity. Wispit abbreviated stands for Women and Wisdom in Socially Powerful and Interesting Times!  So, Let\u2019s begin this journey together!  After all, we sometimes learn and listen more through the examples of others.\n\n",

        "description": "This is show dedicated to those who belong in the space between - not quite fitting into each circle but instead the overlap. Covering topics from pop culture to politics to relationships, \"The Venn Diagram\" explores what it means to be part of a cultural dichotomy through the lens of those living this experience every day. I will cover topics including college, relationships, food, culture, current events, politics, music, and more (the brainstorming list continues). I will also feature guests that can speak to these topics and engage in honest conversations about their individual experiences. My guests will be students, professionals, and human beings alike that are apart of two different cultures (Asian, South Asian, Latinx, African American - BIPOC in general). I am excited to explore these topics and learn from our individual experiences to find the points of relatability and understanding.",

        "description": "Humble Heroes is really my tribute to the many awesome kids, parents, grandparents, celebrities and even pets in your life and mine that have shown us an extra dimension in living. So much news is bad news that tries to drag us down and elevate our fear response. Here\u2019s the chance to turn the tables and celebrate good stuff. \n\nMaybe you have someone in your life like my Aunty Barb \u2013 just a wonderful role-model in handling hard times, never preachy, just had that extra dimension. No matter what went wrong, Aunty Barb would find a good side to it, never panicked, it was all God\u2019s will. \n\nHere\u2019s one example I remember well. In her later years when Barbara wasn\u2019t as nimble or capable as she was in her earlier school librarian days, she decided to go back to England to see her brothers and sisters. As part of that exercise it meant catching a train from London to York with a couple of her brothers. During the trip Aunty Barb excused herself as she had to \u201cgo through\u201d, her quaintly polite way of saying she needed to go to the toilet. After 55 minutes \u201cgoing through\u201d her brothers became concerned so they called on the guard to go and check on her. At first the guard couldn\u2019t get the door open despite Aunty Barb\u2019s faltering invitation to enter, but with mechanical help he managed to prise the door open. There was Aunty Barb sitting on the floor next to the toilet \u2013 she had fallen, passed out, woke up to find herself in this odd predicament but then relaxed knowing that God would send some nice person to help her out! No matter what the change, deterioration, frustration or loss of capacity in her life it was just taken in Aunty Barb\u2019s stride on her way to Heaven! \n\nI haven\u2019t found change that easy to handle and I don\u2019t have Aunty Barb\u2019s blind faith but I\u2019ve loved life and loved the many cases and kids I\u2019ve met - I\u2019ve honestly drawn inspiration from them. If they can do it, so can I! These stories are my attempt to pay homage and respect to ordinary battlers achieving awesome outcomes with an extra dimension. \n\nThe stories are not all serious \u2013 laughter is an important tool in mental health and many of my memories are about characters that just make me giggle when I think of them. Maybe you have a humble hero in your life who you\u2019d like to acknowledge and celebrate. Well here\u2019s your chance to submit stories. Look for the Submit your story tab above and share your story about your humble hero.\n\nIt\u2019s my hope that together we can share heaps of humble heroes and that they can be an inspiration for each other. What a legacy that would be! ",

While I use this platform as a form of expression for myself, I will also be speaking on the topics that are often overlooked by today\u2019s society, emphasizing the importance of shedding light on your past for a brighter future, and of course building a relationship with those who discover my podcast and my voice.

About 3% of total population experience BFRBs but they are rarely spoken about. Barbara is determined to bring more awareness to this class of disorders that have been with her since she was 10 years old. The stories of her guests are incredibly powerful and no matter if you have a BFRB or not, you will learn something about dealing with insecurity and self-acceptance.</p>",

I found myself alone in a closed country, with nothing familiar around me. Because of the extreme circumstances, Jesus became more real to me than ever before, and because there was no one else to rely on, I began to hear His voice loud and so clear. Thus we spent our time in conversation. This is a story that's never fully been told, its about how when everything was stripped away and I had nothing left but Jesus to hold on to, how He became more real to me than ever. It was my adventure with Holy Spirit. Raw, real yet true. I came back with new eyes, and a completely fresh perspective. All that mattered was Him. it was a time of growth and renewal. And the ministry there was something else. Everything that happened had a powerful effect on me, and one that would last a life time. ",

Berawal dari berguru kepada mursyid tariqah masing-masing, kami terus menjelajahi kedalaman kasih Ilahi dalam hidup keseharian.\n\nDalam konteks tasawuf, suwung mengandung makna kekosongan, makna kesadaran berketuhanan. Sering juga dimaknai dengan kata ma\u2019rifat.\n \nKami melakukan dialog, renungan spontan di setiap sesinya. Tema pokok di setiap sesi adalah puisi sakral, ataupun sistematika inspiratif, yang kami gali dari berbagai tradisi.\n\nMelalui dialog spontan ini, kami berkomunikasi dari hati ke hati dengan anda semua.

        "description": "Naturalies.\n \nMy name is Samantha-Jo, I am the host for this amazing podcast that I am hoping save souls. My reasoning for starting this podcast came about after I gave my life to Christ on July 11, 2021. I started finding myself constantly want to talk about my struggles (HOT: humble, open & transparent), the things that have given me strength, the things God has done for me & most importantly the things I know that God has for me. I know you're thinking \"oh here we go with some religious podcast\" but I'm asking that you look deeper than that. I am a Christian & yes I pray this podcast changes lives in ways beyond my belief but if its not enough to convince you to stay I will also mention the other things I am that God has allowed me to be. I am a single Mother of 4, YES FOUR amazing boys who at the end of this year will be 12, 6, 4 & 2. I am a business owner (if you have instagram JosCraftShack & Sheis.waisted).  I am also a nurse, I have been for almost 4 years now. So again if religion isnt enough to convince you to stay then stick around for the other things I have to offer.\n\nWhy Naturalies?\nI recently (1 year ago) left a very toxic relationship after 8 years & literally started completely over in the middle of the pandemic with all 4 children. I literally built my own kitchen table, tv stand, coffee table, my bed & childrens bed & started over knowing only what I thought I knew. Black women have been placed in boxes all of our lives. \"Starting over is harder than you think so you should probably stay\" \"You cant do it without this person or that person\", \"You have to act this way, its not lady like to do it that way\", \"You cant jump out on faith because nobody in our family has done that\", \"You cant be better than what you come from\", \"your idea isnt good enough to take you there\" ALL LIES, LIES, AND MORE LIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PLACED ON BLACK WOMEN & LADIES YOU DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE TO MEET ANY STANDARD YOU, YOURSELF, DID NOT SET! This is my safe haven for black women, no matter what you look like, your body size, your bank account or profession, single mom, married mom, in a bad situation, left a bad situation LISTEN I do not care. Come, let your hair down, act the way you want to act even if it doesn't make sense to anyone else, cry a little, heal a lot & know that this is a sisterhood.\n\nIm so ready for this journey. I love you ladies. ",

It helps sort out all kinds of emotions that I may be going through.\n\nI\u2019ll be sharing devotions from inspirational women like Joyce Meyers, and reading straight from the Bible.

        "description": "Hey y'all! My name is DaAujana and welcome to my spoken word diary. Inspiration for this diary was drawn from a multitude of sources, but the main one being high school and my first semester of college. I've always been shy and introverted and isn't a bad thing by any means, but it has caused me to feel an overwhelming amount emotions that have been not so good along the way. The biggest thing I've had to cope with is being alone and not feeling so confident sometimes - and because of that, it has caused me in the past and in the present to withstand what feels to be an uphill battle. Thus, I want to share my stories with all of you because we are going through our own ups and downs. We are all impacted by the actions of our world and instead of remaining shy and silent, I want to use my voice to empower others through sharing my own stories(both serious and ridiculous ones) and truly journey through the process of stepping out of ones embarrassment, shyness, shame, etc and truly being who you are. This journey is also like a mini journal for me to spill out and say all of the things that I have wanted to express for so long, but hadn't because I was too afraid to- I can only hope that through my courage and my words that it will encourage you all to feel empowered to truly be unapologetically yourself and slowly show people the real you and step into your true prime.\u26a1\ufe0f",

A place where we will contemplate pretty much anything whether it seems life or death or really mundane. Ranging from self-improvement, philosophy, society, relationships, mental health, advice, hot topics; whatever is floating around in my mind. I'd argue one of the best parts of friendship is being able to talk about anything and everything and go really deep into random topics. Butttt sometimes my social battery is dead (really most of the time) but I'm still craving these types of convos. What better way for us all to get out of our heads and get a little thoughtful from the comfort of our solitude. This will be our little cozy space to pretend we're besties and get into it. \n\u2661\nnew episode every sunday\nmy instagram: https://www.instagram.com/nicoleserbel/",

See below:\nS22 \u4e2d\u6587 - \u96ea\u58eb\u9054\u5c71\u8207\u6211\nS11 The mountain is calling, i must go.\n\n\nUpdated on April 30, 2022: i was guided to rename the show as \"Journeys to Mt Shasta\".\n\n\nMt Shasta is a magical place that i call \u201cHOME\u201d especially in the spiritual way. Ever since my first visit Mt Shasta back in October 2011, my entire life has been shifting and transforming to the levels that i could never ever imagine how my life has becoming now and continuing to evolve to be better and greater.\n\nStarting podcasting \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d is one of my latest assignments from Mt Shasta, so the Mother Earth Heart energy could reach out to the world further and influence more people\u2019s lives to shifting our consciousness as a whole.\n\nIf you know about Mt Shasta, you probably heard of Lemuria, Telos, High Priest Adama, Master Saint Germain and so many more\u2026 And yet, \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d is going to be based on my personal experience with Mt Shasta. To share my real life transformation examples will be the main attribute of this show. In addition to just my own storytelling, there will be soul families and friends to share their profound enlightenment experience with Mt Shasta. \n\ni am so excited about this new way of storytelling, instead of trying to publish \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d book 1, 2,3, which i started a few years back and somehow i did not go too far and just suddenly stopped.  Now i believe it\u2019s time. Thank you, Mt Shasta and the Spirits. i am in gratitude!\n\ni am also starting a Chinese / Mandarin version of \"Mt Shasta and i\" show. They will not be the exact same duplicates with only language difference. They will have their own uniqueness individually. \n\ni understand having two shows at the same time is a huge task, but i have always feel that i want to do both since the beginning. Now, i just need to start the first step and slowly build up the momentum. Constantly reminding myself not to push myself too hard. Learn to pace myself and remember to breathe.\n\ni am a going-with-the-flow kind of guy, so it is not going to be in chronological order about my story. i will just follow the guidance from Mt Shasta and the Spirit!",

        "description": "Der Podcast \"Vom Gangster zum B\u00fcrger\" ist ein medienp\u00e4dagogisches Projekt vom Heinrich-Wetzlar-Haus der Jugendeinrichtung Schloss Stutensee gGmbH.\n\nDas Heinrich-Wetzlar-Haus, kurz HWH, ist ein Angebot der U-Haft-Vermeidung gem\u00e4\u00df \u00a7 71,2 und \u00a7 72,4 JGG. Hier werden seit Juni 1984 m\u00e4nnliche delinquente Jugendliche im Alter von 14 bis 18 Jahren mit dem Leitgedanken \u201eErziehungshilfe statt Untersuchungshaft\u201c betreut.\n\nZiel des Podcast ist es nicht, True Crime Geschichten zu erz\u00e4hlen, sondern den Blick \u00fcber den Tellerrand zu wagen. Den Jugendlichen soll die M\u00f6glichkeit gegeben werden, sich von dem Bild des \u201eGangsters\u201c frei zu machen, indem sie von ihren Geschichten, Emotionen und Biografien erz\u00e4hlen. Die Jugendlichen sollen damit die Chance erhalten, als junge Menschen gesehen zu werden, die nicht nur delinquentes Verhalten zeigen, sondern auch ganz einfache Jugendliche mit all ihren Facetten und u. a. auch mit ihren individuellen Schicksalen sind. Dies soll der h\u00e4ufigen Stigmatisierung der Jugendlichen im Heinrich-Wetzlar-Haus entgegenwirken und die Jugendlichen f\u00fcr alle Zuh\u00f6rer greifbarer und nahbarer machen. \n\nNeben den pers\u00f6nlichen Geschichten der Jugendlichen gibt der Podcast \u201eVom Gangster zum B\u00fcrger\u201c auch Einblicke in den HWH-Alltag und in das p\u00e4dagogische Konzept der Vermeidung von Untersuchungshaft. Die Themen \u201eStraff\u00e4llige Jugendliche, Straftaten, Haft, neue Wege gehen, neue Perspektiven schaffen\u201c werden aus verschiedenen Blickwinkeln (straff\u00e4llige Jugendliche, p\u00e4dagogische Mitarbeitende, Anw\u00e4lte, Richter o. \u00e4.) betrachtet. Damit m\u00f6chte der Podcast zudem Transparenz schaffen sowie Aufkl\u00e4rung und Pr\u00e4vention leisten. Die Podcast-Folgen, die verst\u00e4rkt in Interview-Form gehalten sind, wobei die Jugendlichen in die Rollen des Interviewenden als auch des Interviewten schl\u00fcpfen, sollen junge Menschen darin best\u00e4rken, ihre Ziele zu verfolgen sowie die Chance auf ein gutes Leben zu ergreifen. Humorvolle Berichterstattung aus dem HWH als auch reine Erz\u00e4hlungen sorgen dar\u00fcber hinaus f\u00fcr Abwechslung. \n\nIntro + Outro: Lovely Em 150 Beat von \"Goose Park Productions\", zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt von BUFARAH e.

        "description": "My podcasts are about the everyday life struggles some of us encounter and are forced to deal with on our own. My podcasts are for people like myself, the 'underdogs', people who go through things in life who have to fight their battles alone, who don't have anyone else except themselves for (emotional) support of any kind. If you are a person who's faced with more trials and tribulations in your everyday life than the average person does, then these podcasts are for you. If you suffer from mental health issues that stem from wrong that's been done to you and have no one to talk to or you think or feel that no one understands what you're going through, if you feel your life consists of nothing but unfair and negative challenges that you always seem to end up on the loosing end of & your constantly misjudged by those around you - especially people you thought would understand, these podcasts are for you. \nLife isn't always fair, that's just the way it goes, but for some people life seems to be truly and constantly unfair all the way around. After a while it takes a serious toll on you & it affects us in unimaginable ways, mentally, physically, emotionally & sometimes even sociably & when you don't have anyone except yourself to rely on, times that are already difficult to deal with or get through become 10 times harder. We don't always have the right answers to the issues that life can bring, we just do the best we can with what we have - & sometimes all we have is ourselves to get us by & if you know like I know, even though all we have in the end are ourselves, the flip side (truth) is, no one is meant to get through this thing called life alone, but for some of us, people like myself, we're forced to. My podcasts aren't for the 'elite', meaning, it's not for people who don't have these kind of problems or people who have been through something at some point in their life & have come out on 'top' & it all worked out to their benefit in the end, no. These podcasts are for 'us', the 'underdogs' - people who fight just to get by but just can't seem to 'get ahead' because everything that life continues to serve up to them is just one fucked up issue after another that continues to knock you down. Of course when you get knocked down you get back up, you have to, but people need to realize that even though you get back up after being knocked down, every knock down leaves you wounded & when getting knocked down is one right behind the other, as you continue to 'get back up', you're not getting up with as much strength as you had before & when it continues to happen (& often), yes you get back up, but the fight in you continues to weaken which means, the next 'knock down' is going to take more of a toll on your inner strength than you may have to give. \nPeople who don't have these types of issues, or have been through things in their life where getting up wasn't as difficult after a few 'knock downs' will not be able to relate to my podcasts, & that's ok because these podcast are not for you so the judgements, feel free to keep to yourself or go enjoy another channel that applies to you. People LOVE judging others, especially when your problems aren't theirs but that's not right. My podcasts offer compassion & understanding to the 'underdogs' - people who's life's are unfairly judged by others - other's usually sitting in a very comfortable position who have the audacity to look or talk down on or about others who are not as 'fortunate' as they are. Believe me when I tell you that I understand how it feels to be an 'underdog' & my podcasts are for us.\n\nDisclaimer: I am no scholar, I am no Dr. Phil, I am just a regular everyday person who's dealing with life and the issues I'm dealt the best way I can, alone. Although alone is not the way I choose to deal with my life issues, it's the way I'm forced to deal with them.",

We call them Phoebes. In Romans Chapter 16, Apostle Paul describes Phoebe as a servant, friend, confidant, and helper of many. Phoebes are women who are placed in others' lives to fill those gaps that life may have caused and are motivated by love and a servant's attitude. They showed up in the lives of ordinary people at the right place and time to help them navigate the muddy waters of life. In the podcasts, you will hear stories about victory over addiction, abuse, teenage pregnancy, loss and so much more that life throws our way. The beautiful souls you will hear from are sharing from the heart -- unscripted -- about their Phoebe(s) and how they made it to the other side of their struggles. The presence and value of Phoebe may not be realized for some time, but when the pieces of their life's story are revisited, their impact is acknowledged. Honor, hope, and healing...that is what you will get. Sit back, relax, and enjoy Real Talk for Real Women: Let the Healing Begin!</p>",

The beginning, biggest victories, character climax, and loss that each chapter of life can bring.\u00a0When we are on the mountain top we worship God, and when we are in the valley, we cry out to God.\u00a0\n\nBut, we live most of our life in the day to day, where we just go through the motions. So how do we keep up a bold faith \"between the pages\" of life?\u00a0\n\nThat is what \"Between The Pages\" is all about! We are challenging the conversations to dive deeper in how we can live out our faith.\u00a0\n\nJoin us every other Wednesday as we talk to different guests, team members, community leaders about topics that will leave you feeling challenged and encouraged!\u00a0\n\nContinue the conversation each week on our Instagram @boldlyseeking\n",

        "description": "<p>What was THAT? This podcast will focus on survival and pushing forward after life events, tragic or not. Life after illness, Life after abuse, Life after a career, Life after whatever else happens! Season 1 focuses on the survivors of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)--widows, widowers, partners, friends, siblings, children, etc. Each of our participants will have 2 episodes, the first being their story--Life AFTER the diagnosis, the onslaught of the changing dynamics of the disease, and how it changed relationships, and life. The second episode for each story will focus on Life After THAT monster and how they are moving on or not and what might help themselves and others. In other words, how are they now carrying on? ALS is considered rare, yet it kills tens of thousands in the United States annually and many more worldwide. Most ALS patients live 2-5 years from diagnosis, but not all. Regardless, the body movements die off while the mind usually stays vibrant. Most of those affected wouldn\u2019t wish the disease on their worst enemy and would actually prefer cancer over ALS...because except in rare cases, there\u2019s at least a chance to survive with the other. In either case, loved ones are changed forever, and suffer from PTSD, depression, etc. The importance of spreading awareness of the disease is important, but so is acknowledging what the caretakers and loved ones have been through. This season provides that opportunity, a sounding board if you will, and hopefully what my late husband, also a victim of ALS, encouraged...\u201dKeep on keepin\u2019 on because being sad or mad will not do you any good. Be happy.\u201d</p>",

Maar we zijn niet zomaar een doorsnee paar \u2013 we zijn druk bezig met het verkennen van de wereld van ethische non-monogamie en polyamorie binnen onze relatie. En laten we eerlijk zijn, dat is soms best wel een kronkelige weg. We misten de ervaringen van anderen en inzichten tijdens dit avontuur, dus hebben we besloten om deze podcast te lanceren. \"If you dont't see the change, be the change.\"</p><p>Ons doel? We willen graag onze frisse, nieuwe ervaringen met jou delen en hopen dat jij er ook iets uit kunt halen. Maar dat is niet alles. Naast het duiken in de wereld van ethische non-monogamie en polyamorie, snijden we ook regelmatig andere onderwerpen aan die gerelateerd zijn aan de LGBTQIAP+ gemeenschap.</p><p>Maar, en dit is belangrijk, we willen wel even duidelijk maken dat we niet de alleswetende experts zijn. In feite nemen we je mee in ons proces terwijl we zelf nog aan het ontdekken zijn. We weten dat we onderweg tegen allerlei uitdagingen gaan aanlopen. Dus, neem alsjeblieft niet alles wat we zeggen als d\u00e9 onwrikbare waarheid, maar eerder als onze gedachten en bevindingen op dat moment.</p><p>Als je nog dieper in de onderwerpen wilt duiken die we bespreken, raden we je zeker aan om naast onze podcast ook andere bronnen te raadplegen. Hoe dan ook, we hopen dat je ontzettend veel plezier beleeft aan het luisteren naar onze gesprekken!</p><p>Oh, en vergeet niet om ons te volgen:</p><p>https://instagram.com/polymolydepodcast?igshid=MzNlNGNkZWQ4Mg==</p>",

Deep down, what we all want is a safe space. And if you\u2019ve been searching, welcome home.\n\nSafe Space Podcast, was created with this in mind. A place to pause and have candid, open conversations about the intersectionality of who we are without refrain.  Here in this space will we talk about the highs and lows of life, relationships, love, faith and more. We will laugh, cry, pray and so much more. Most importantly we will grow:  with each other and with ourselves. \n\nJoin me, your host TaMar, as the room grows a little bigger, but the safety, openness and honesty remain the same.",

I\u2019m happy to share.\nIt\u2019s not just the death that we experience grief from. We experience all kinds of losses, changes and adjustments here and there\u2026 and grief is ultimately necessary in our lives to feel joy and love\u2026\nBut grief is powerful and we tend to numb it..And it is something we hardly ever talk about.

Senior Elba Heddesheimer created the <em>Our Roots, Our Stories</em> podcast to share these stories with her school community. We hope to provide students with the platform to voice their unique cultural perspectives and experiences.</p><p>Each episode features a 3-5 minute story from one of our students that was shared at a February storytelling night in the Green Key. These heartwarming stories touch on their hometowns, their experiences at WRA, and the realizations they\u2019ve made through self-reflection. The first few episodes relate to the theme, 'Places We Call Home,' but we're excited to explore other themes in the future.</p><p>Storytelling is a powerful tool for fostering cross-cultural competency and understanding. We encourage all WRA students to attend the next storytelling night on April 7 from 6:30-7:30 in the Green Key. Students will reflect on the theme \u201cTransitions,\u201d discussing the changes and challenges they have faced while navigating life.</p><p>So if you're a student at WRA, I invite you to join us in celebrating our diverse community and the incredible stories that come with it.</p><p>Contact the Host?</p><p>heddesheimere23@wra.net</p>",

Often times, we suffer in silence and don't know how to talk about it.

        "description": "<p>it's a weird saying \"it is what it is\", but for most of us, hearing it from someone; friend, family or co-worker; brings an almost sad sense of \"they've seen some shit\".  A common saying among people, who at some point have or are on the verge of giving up, it's also a mantra of the strong.  A sense that no matter what happens, things will work out, and somehow you will get through it.  It is of course what it is.  </p><p>\u200b</p><p>Love sucks...so does everything that comes with it.  The joy, the memories and the eventual breakup.  Where the memories formed become a reminder of what you had, the plans and ideas you shared with that special someone sting more then ever; in a timeless void of \"shoulda, coulda, woulda.\" Of course, seeing a former partner, girlfriend, boyfriend etc happy is all you really want at the end of the day. Weather its with or without you.  While fostering and attempting to grow a friendship and keep the bond strong in whatever manner you can has its struggles and a daily reminder of what could have been, the bonds to friendship come with the same unique struggles.  </p><p>\u200b</p><p>This episode is my personal journey through a love found in the most unlikely of places (Grindr), to the good times and memories built, to post break-up and the daily struggle to split what was and what is.  An hour long talk of how my former relationship changed me for the good the bad and the ugly, and the gratitude that I have daily that the individual is still in my life.  Weather with me as a partner or friend.  How do you deal with breakups and how do you; over time; numb the heartache and flashbacks of the small traditions, memories and things that make you laugh? </p>",

        "description": "<p>The Talkin Story podcast is a new project of Well Organized/Black Lives Matter of Jefferson County. It features local people of the global majority (PGM) who are quietly acting as flashpoints for social and cultural transformation within Port Townsend/East Jefferson county. These are the people who have been steadily working almost under the radar to craft a world in which they exist with sovereignty and creativity. They may or may not be in designated leadership roles, but their very existence is a source of inspiration and a touchstone within the PGM community primarily and the broader community as well.</p><p>The first season of this intergenerational podcast is co-hosted by Oceana Sawyer, Ezra Kikue Cook, and Lorenzo McCleese.</p><p>Oceana is an eldering person of African descent who moves in the liminal spaces of life &amp; death, capture &amp; liberation. They are a poet and a writer with a vision of community of local PGM that has the capacity to navigate the reality of liquid modernity.</p><p>Ezra is an ever changing force for change. As much as they talk, you'll never really understand them. His look is always changing and his list of passions is always expanding. Professionally he is known for working at Centrum for the last three years as both a grip and a videographer/broadcast technician. Ezra has years of experience in theater tech, acting, and media production. They are a writer and director with dreams of putting out original films on the big screen. They believe in the importance of advocacy and integrity- the fight for what is right at the small level. They are particularly involved in activism for Queer and Transgender support systems at the local level. Ezra is the eldest son of James Cook, born in Yokohama Japan, and Mirandy Cook, born in the United States. Working on this podcast has helped him to connect to his Japanese American heritage and BIPOC identity.</p><p>Lorenzo is a recent graduate from Port Townsend High School (PTHS) and a freshman at the University of Washington (UW). He has done work for the BIPOC Family Excursion Program, PTHS BIPOC Student Union, and most recently, been a host on the Talkin\u2019 Story Podcast.</p><p>Being born &amp; raised in Port Townsend, Lorenzo is eager to move out to Seattle and study Environmental Science. He hopes to continue engaging with his passion for equity and diversity in Seattle. Lorenzo is a member of the 7th cohort of UW\u2019s Brotherhood Initiative; a program that provides opportunities for academic growth and leadership for underrepresented men of color.</p>",

        "description": "<p>The inspiration for this podcast came from Raghavendra, a friend I met in India in 2012 through couchsurfing. Our bond grew over the years, and during a trip to India in 2023, he suggested I start a podcast. Despite being jetlagged and high, I embraced the idea. My wife was initially hesitant due to concerns about quality, but I decided to dive in and improve as I go.</p><p>A bit about me: I was born in Sverdlovsk, now Ekaterinburg, known for its historical significance and as a cultural crossroad between Europe and Asia. My upbringing was challenging. After the 1998 economic crisis, my father turned to alcohol, leading to his separation from our family when I was 13. My mother worked multiple jobs to support us. I wasn't academically inclined, but my mother's guidance led me to study project management at Ural State Technical University. During my studies, my sister introduced me to the Work&amp;Travel program in the USA. My trip to Maine in 2006 was transformative, exposing me to a new culture and broadening my horizons. After university, I also earned a military degree, ironically in bridge-building, given my humanities background.</p><p>This is just the beginning of my story, and I have much more to share.</p><p>The topics that I plan to cover in this podcast: politics, psychedelics, feminism, marketing, business, sex, drugs, music, philosophy, change, humans, etc.</p>",
