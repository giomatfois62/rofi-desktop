As two young Catholics, they experienced what a lot of people go through: high and lows of relationships, typical college life, and the questioning of their purpose on earth. But through all of this they maintained one thing, and that is staying true to the faith. In this podcast, they talk about the meaning of staying true to the faith, finding a religious/spiritual community, dating for marriage, and so much more! Whether you are religious or not, we invite everyone to listen with opening ears and hearts as we strive to break societal stereotypes, create a loving community, and spread positive messages.

        "description": "At the start of 2010's spring semester, APSU student, W.S. Walker walked out of his dorm room in the middle of a blizzard with only two blank books, and lived the next 44 days without any money or ID, going where the wind blew. Because of a single discovery, he stopped everything to walk out into the world, throwing wide open all of his defenses, and making himself completely vulnerable to anyone he met. And what was the discovery which caused this? The massive hidden secret behind what laughter is and why we find something funny. \n<p><p>\nHave you ever tried to explain why somethings are funny and somethings aren't? Tune in to W. S. Walker's The Laughing Matters, the ground-breaking book, read chapter by chapter by the author (and then all manner of advice, musings, and wisdoms after Season 1), and hang on as he sends you reeling through some of the most incredible discoveries on human behavior, why we don't feel right so much of the time, and the core blueprint for the universal design of happiness; things hidden in plain sight your entire life and answers that you never would have expected. The moment you hear them, you will understand that you've always known them.<p>The true motivations behind why we laugh will shock you to your core.<p>\n<p><p><i><b>A fair bit of warning: once you hear some of the hidden truths, you cannot unhear them. They are night and day obvious once you know which angle to see them from. </b></i><p><p>\n\nThis is an advanced edition. The book has not been publicly released yet. If you want a much better understanding of who you are, why you don't feel important, where so much of your internal conflict (at a base-level) comes from, come on in and have a listen. <p><p>\n\nI've got some good news, and some bad news for you.\n<p><p>\nyoutube.com/couldhelp<p>\nwww.thelaughingmatters.com<p>\nfacebook.com/icouldhelp<p>\nwillhelpmail@gmail.com\n\n",

The goal is to hopefully help someone, anyone, who desires more out of this life. Wispit is not a medical forum, but more of an encapsulation of  the experiences and words of wisdom of many people, some of whom are colleagues and friends, as a time capsule.   In this journey, I will interview people of various ages, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Although this podcast is designed by a woman, it is not limited simply to women.  It is my hope that anyone, and everyone who tunes in, will be enriched, edified, spiritually touched, and moved to bypass the challenges of life,  and rise from the ashes of this limited existence to a higher elevation of thinking and creativity. Wispit abbreviated stands for Women and Wisdom in Socially Powerful and Interesting Times!  So, Let\u2019s begin this journey together!  After all, we sometimes learn and listen more through the examples of others.\n\n",

Kuinka \"me\" n\u00e4ytt\u00e4ytyy yksil\u00f6tasolla ja kuinka \"min\u00e4\" k\u00e4ytt\u00e4ytyy yhteisell\u00e4 tasolla? Puhumme rehellisesti tantrisesta seksuaalisuudesta, tunteista ja kasvustamme t\u00e4ss\u00e4 suhteessa.\n\nAleksi on kouluttautunut kundaliinijoogaohjaaja. Lis\u00e4ksi Aleksin henkisiin harjoitteisiin kuuluvat hengitys- ja kehonpainoharjoitteet, laulu, kitaransoitto, leikkimielisyys, vapaa ekstaattinen tanssi sek\u00e4 suuri rakkaus ja kunnioitus kylm\u00e4altistusta kohtaan.

        "description": "Spiritual Warfare is real and raging around us - while end times prophecy, the Book of Revelations and worldwide culture are colliding on a pace and scale we've never seen before - but were we warned this would happen?  \n\nThe Fourth Watch is a group of people from all walks of American life that were looking to go deeper with the Holy Spirit.  We see the world through the lens of Jesus which results in spiritual warfare becoming a chosen lifestyle vs the commonly seen apathetic and lethargic country club church going Christian.\n\nWhat does that mean to you and I?  To abandon the comfort of living with our eyes closed - to help the church wake up, to see the enemies work all around us for what it is and to remain vigilant, looking for opportunities to engage the enemy in prayer.\n\nThere's only one way to stir the church from comfort and lethargy - change your perspective, change your footing on the full measure of the word, pray for wisdom and discernment and ask the Lord to show you how you're called righteous indignation and Holy Spirit inspired anger.  \n\nEphesian armor was meant for everyone which means all of us are called to battle - but some of us are called to war.  Journey with us as we discuss the ways we choose to see and engage in Spiritual Warfare, and listen along as we challenge each other and discuss how to change our collective Christian footing before revival on the way up becomes revival on the way down.\n\nWe love the church and we want to see it become the Biblical foundation this country was founded on - but we also know at some point the cultural church will vilify and hunt down Holy Spirit filled Christ followers as they work to fulfill the Anti-Christ's agenda and purpose.\n\nThis isn't your normal, average watered down Christian podcast - but we encourage you to engage and test everything we say against the Holy Spirit, and to find your place as a watchman on the walls as Christ prepares us for His return.\n\nGod Bless and Godspeed",

Areas and problems in society which aren\u2019t always discussed publicly whether it's from shame or embarrassment. I want to create safe space for women to take their power back.

        "description": "It often feels humanity has gone a bit astray. I get it. What are we doing here? I\u2019m Samantha Sacchi from The Self Club. I always knew life was this temporary experience- a soul in a borrowed physical body, I wasn\u2019t sure why so many people spent so much time on things that don\u2019t matter at all. I get it now, they just didn\u2019t know. They were all still asleep. \n\nI\u2019m deep and have been writing, philosophizing, and trying to understand life since I\u2019m 10. I moved 18 times across 4 continents by the age of 28, which also made me question pretty much everything. My background is in International Economics and Business, Leadership Development and Emotional Intelligence. I've studied from neuro-linguistic programming\u200b, to Reiki and Akashic records, to natural and holistic nutrition to look at life from a truly holistic perspective\u200b. \n\nThis podcast is a conscious rebellion to shift from a \u200bfear-based system that keeps us small and doubtful to a way of living based on truth, trust and love as we access our own innate wisdom. A new paradigm that starts with radical self-awareness, a new educational system and a conscious way of being human - combining ancient wisdom with modern knowledge. I'll be hosting and bringing you conversations with conscious souls that are part of this shift. \n\nThis new paradigm starts with you.",

This includes marrying mysticism, science, religions, ancient medicines, sexuality, tribal rituals, psychology, health and fitness and much more.\n\nIt's time to enhance and expand our collective consciousness by breaking free from mind influencing conditionings of who we once believed to be and to begin finding the commonalities in one another to empower each of us of who we are truly meant to be...

I am Joe Hodgson and I will be having discussions various other collaborators on consciousness, UFOs, dimensions, ET races and all manner of topics that are of interest. The last few years have been rather eye opening for me and I have been down many bizarre rabbit holes as I try to discover the truth about who we are, how it all began and what is the true nature of reality. On this journey I have also become more and more aware of how important it is for us all to up the vibe and raise our consciousness so that we are not caught up in continuous cycles of war and division anymore. Instead, we can look forward to a future of peace and unity which will in time allow us to become a galactic species. There are many forces working extremely hard to stop our planetary ascension but by having these discussions and by opening our minds to a myriad of amazing possibilities for humanity, we can ensure our paths are towards the light and not the dark. I hope you will enjoy listening to our discussions, we are a group of individuals that found each other with the CE5 protocols which are becoming more and more popular as people want to know more about our place in the universe and whether there is intelligent life out there in the cosmos. Although Steven Greer's CE5 protocols have brought us together and we have had some success dipping our feet in initiating contact with other intelligent beings, it has also been a great way to bring together like minded individuals who are spiritual, open minded and eager to help in any way they can to assist humanity in its path to ascension.",

        "title": "Healing From The Holy Land",
        "description": "In this podcast series I explore various aspects of holistic healing, as an Intuitive Healer experiencing the world and the healing energies around us.\nWe will touch on, and go in-depth about, many topics - including Meridians, Chakras, Yin Yang energy, self-healing techniques, Flower Essences, Meditations, Guided Imagery, Color Healing, and the effect of the cosmos on individuals and the world via zodiac signs and other cosmic events (moon phases, eclipses, meteor showers and the like). Content is intuitively guided and so what comes up is what I will be talking about!\nOften, if not always, content reflects what is going on in my own personal healing journey, or what I see coming up for those around me, or both.\nHere's a bit about me and my background:\nI was born in America and lived there for just over two decades before I moved to Israel with my family over 20 years ago. \nI am a Holistic Healer with over ten years of experience practicing CranioBalance Therapy, have a thriving range of Flower Essences (Beit Roga Gardens*) made from flowers, trees, and elements in my home community in Israel, as well as from the Dead Sea, and run a private practice called Beit Roga* (House of Tranquility). I have learned many other holistic healing techniques along the way, and all my healing is done on an intuitive level. (*Check out more at beitroga.com and beitroga.com/shop)\nI started out as a Physical Therapist and quickly learned that I was healing via intuitive feedback. I also recognized that simply dealing with the physical aspect of a client's pain or dysfunction was not dealing with the whole picture. \nOver the years I have trusted my inner knowing and followed my intuitive guidance to learning more and more about holistic healing, and most importantly, to trusting the information that comes to me intuitively. It all links back together and each time I learn another aspect of healing I am amazed anew at all the inter-connections. It all comes from one Source, and that is made clear over and over again. \nWe are living in exciting, magical times when more and more healing is coming up to the surface. Old healing practices coming back to modern day use, intuitive guidance on the rise in peoples' awareness, holistic healing becoming more and more popular with the general population, and a greater forum expanding globally for all this information to come to light.\nIf you have found me, then there is magic here for you to explore. I look forward to reading your comments about how this information resonates for you. \nDevorah Harow\nAlchemist and Intuitive Healer\nIsrael\nHealing from the Holy Land\n",

As the rest of the world weighs out the long-planned Great Reset, the New Human challenges that the greatest transformation of humanity will take place on the inside first. We explore the paradigms of spiritual practice, dogma, societal mass consciousness and its ongoing programming, and propose new ways to discover our own deepest truths. We learn how to discover a deeper resonance beyond our five senses.\n\nFrom Med-Beds to Frequency Medicine, Extra-Terrestrial civilizations to using the human body as a frequency antennae, spirituality, oneness, ancient wisdom leading to full-energetic awakening, the sky\u2019s the limit as we conceptualize together, the latest discoveries and ideas that will transform the progress of the human race in the way it was always intended - a more natural and connected soul-driven evolution. \n\nWe\u2019ve all heard about the New Earth. Let\u2019s take the journey together to uncover this new human that will thrive as it brings forth its Golden Age, ensuring that the next human evolution is for the betterment of all.\n\n~ Hosts, Jasmine Sterling and Sarrah Powell\n~ Original Music by permission of artist Ray McGeehan   https://amzn.to/3M3MPKg\n\nwww.sarrahpowell.com\nwww.bighappyplanet.com",

        "description": "Christian... A title synonymous with son's of God. But many that carry the title more than lack in their abilities to reflect the attributes given of God. Unfortunately Christianity as a whole has failed to be evidence of the Glory of God among men, but this was the first thing that Christ did in all His works. So how could we possibly declare the deity of the word made flesh and fail to reflect all that he made possible in us? \n\n   From one end of God's word to the other, we were warned of the short comings that would befall much of the body of Christ. This is the venue designed to give revelation of the elements that have effectually hindered us from walking as Son's of the most high. The question is what will you do once you know the truth? \n   In the call of a modern day Apostle it is imperative that my actions and intent clearly manifest honor of all that God is. Moreover I declare nothing of myself except that I must be subject to the directives of His Holy Spirit.  For even as in times past, a true Apostle must glorify God in all of his endeavors. The mandate to point the hearts of man back to Father God is the sole purpose of my ministry efforts. A messenger need not prove a thing, God will reveal Himself. That is to all who dare to truly seek Him.\n   Change isn't a hard thing at all. the problem is accepting that there is a need for change. If you can muster the revelation of your own hidden motives, I can guarantee that the teachings to be found here will be a great assistance in finding the launch pad for change in your own life.\n",

        "title": "Bill Crockett: Touch of the Master's Hand",
        "description": "The \"Touch of the Master's Hand\" is a Christian poem written in 1921 by Myra Brooks Welch. It is depicted in the painting by Ken Brooks used in our Podcast cover art. It tells of an old, battered violin that is about to be sold as the last item in an auction. The highest bid was $3. When suddenly a man in the back of the auction hall walked to the front of the building, took the violin from the auctioneer, wiped off the dust, tuned it and began to play. As he played, the patrons could hardly believe that such a melody could come from such a battered instrument. The violinist finished playing, handed the instrument back to the auctioneer, and walked back to his seat. Amazed and astonished the auctioneer softly said, \"Now how much am I bid for this violin?\" Instead of $3, the violin was sold for $3,000. The crowd asked, \"What was it that suddenly brought value to such a battered instrument?\" The auctioneer replied, \"It was the touch of the master's hand!\" The poem goes on to draw the analogy between the violin and a person whose life has been battered and torn by sin. Just as the master violinist brought value to the old violin, Jesus, our Creator, the Master of the universe and lover of our soul, will make our lives valuable, no matter how battered we may be!\n\nBill Crockett has a masters degree in Biblical Exposition and has served as an evangelist, pastor, counsellor and Bible Conference speaker across the US and in many countries. Bill also worked in corporate sales and sales management for almost 25 years. Having experienced divorce, the loss of a job, death of an immediate family member and depression to the point of suicide, he understands the ups and downs of life. At one point feeling as if God did not love or care about him, he discovered the true meaning of a personal walk with God and found renewed purpose and value as God touched his life once again!\n\n\"Touch of the Master's Hand\" is a podcast sharing practical truths from the Bible that will help us realize our value and live productive and fulfilled lives as we are touched by the truth of God's Word.",

The truth is - we make no deposits, and we need no loans. We have been redeemed by Him. He paid the price and the ransom for our souls\u2014all of it, in full, for all of us\u2014with His blood. Living the gospel of Jesus Christ is not about earning our salvation, a concept that only leads to frustration and failure. Living the gospel of Jesus Christ is about choosing daily to qualify for His gift that He freely offers us, by relying wholly on Him. The gospel is a system of redemption. The gospel is not a system to promote the assimilation of virtuous habits and the accumulation of good deeds\u2014all people can achieve worthy goals and live good lives. In Redeemed Through His Blood, we learn how others have experienced redemption and we discuss how each of us may access the power of Christ and His Atonement, which will bring His joy and His peace into our lives.</p>",

I created this podcast so listeners could have a safe space to let their guard down and get in touch with their true selves. \n\nI was the biggest people pleaser who matched my energy to those around me because I thought that was the way to figure out what made me happy. Turns out, I just needed to get in touch with who I truly am and what I desire in this life. Now I am no longer a people pleaser, and am able to live my life more authentically to who I am. \n\nI have created my business through using my intuitive abilities to help others realize who tf they are. I am taking you through the lessons I have learned throughout this journey and the lessons I have yet to learn.\n\nIf you are looking for a podcast that is raw, real, full of love, acceptance, and life lessons, you've found it. Thank you for being on this journey with me. \n\n",

See below:\nS22 \u4e2d\u6587 - \u96ea\u58eb\u9054\u5c71\u8207\u6211\nS11 The mountain is calling, i must go.\n\n\nUpdated on April 30, 2022: i was guided to rename the show as \"Journeys to Mt Shasta\".\n\n\nMt Shasta is a magical place that i call \u201cHOME\u201d especially in the spiritual way. Ever since my first visit Mt Shasta back in October 2011, my entire life has been shifting and transforming to the levels that i could never ever imagine how my life has becoming now and continuing to evolve to be better and greater.\n\nStarting podcasting \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d is one of my latest assignments from Mt Shasta, so the Mother Earth Heart energy could reach out to the world further and influence more people\u2019s lives to shifting our consciousness as a whole.\n\nIf you know about Mt Shasta, you probably heard of Lemuria, Telos, High Priest Adama, Master Saint Germain and so many more\u2026 And yet, \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d is going to be based on my personal experience with Mt Shasta. To share my real life transformation examples will be the main attribute of this show. In addition to just my own storytelling, there will be soul families and friends to share their profound enlightenment experience with Mt Shasta. \n\ni am so excited about this new way of storytelling, instead of trying to publish \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d book 1, 2,3, which i started a few years back and somehow i did not go too far and just suddenly stopped.  Now i believe it\u2019s time. Thank you, Mt Shasta and the Spirits. i am in gratitude!\n\ni am also starting a Chinese / Mandarin version of \"Mt Shasta and i\" show. They will not be the exact same duplicates with only language difference. They will have their own uniqueness individually. \n\ni understand having two shows at the same time is a huge task, but i have always feel that i want to do both since the beginning. Now, i just need to start the first step and slowly build up the momentum. Constantly reminding myself not to push myself too hard. Learn to pace myself and remember to breathe.\n\ni am a going-with-the-flow kind of guy, so it is not going to be in chronological order about my story. i will just follow the guidance from Mt Shasta and the Spirit!",

This podcast was birthed from a really special place, in a moment of complete surrender and transformation. It comes from a place of pure love for all that is in this wild world we live in. \n\nThe title for me represents a change in thinking, a change in being. Until not long ago I spent my life carrying around this feeling of never fitting in, self isolating, keeping my vulnerable side silent and afraid of completely owning who I am, rejecting myself before someone else could reject me. Mind you I didn't realise I was doing any of this in the moment. Self reflection and awareness what a beautiful thing! \n\nFor so long I craved that feeling of being accepted, of fitting in but what I didn't realise was that it was me who needed to accept myself all along. My intention for this podcast is to help people find their sense of peace, love, sexuality, pleasure and purpose as well as wholeness and appreciation for all that is.\n\nEveryone is welcome here. You are welcomed, love and accepted here. \n\nThis podcast is going to be fun, random, chaotic and full of #livelaughlove energy because thats who I am. \n\nConnect with me on my instagram @whowantstofitinanyway\n\nCant wait to connect.\n\nLater lovers,\nBec x\n\n",

We call them Phoebes. In Romans Chapter 16, Apostle Paul describes Phoebe as a servant, friend, confidant, and helper of many. Phoebes are women who are placed in others' lives to fill those gaps that life may have caused and are motivated by love and a servant's attitude. They showed up in the lives of ordinary people at the right place and time to help them navigate the muddy waters of life. In the podcasts, you will hear stories about victory over addiction, abuse, teenage pregnancy, loss and so much more that life throws our way. The beautiful souls you will hear from are sharing from the heart -- unscripted -- about their Phoebe(s) and how they made it to the other side of their struggles. The presence and value of Phoebe may not be realized for some time, but when the pieces of their life's story are revisited, their impact is acknowledged. Honor, hope, and healing...that is what you will get. Sit back, relax, and enjoy Real Talk for Real Women: Let the Healing Begin!</p>",

The pathless path is the inner path of Shakti-the embodiment of Consciousness as the Goddess within and without. She is the cause of all dynamic and kinetic energy of the entire Cosmos. She creates, sustains and destroys at will when the time is ready. She is accessible to all of us at any time, with unconditional love and no qualifications needed except with a sincere approach, and commitment to receive her love, beauty and power in the many ways she expresses in reality. Join me on this journey as we cover many topics as numerous as her myriad of expressions in nature and in the cosmos. This journey will enable personal transformation should you choose it. It is your warrior's path if you should decide to wield the sword to cut through delusions, illusions and concepts of what life is about. It empowers you to choose authenticity and being centered instead of being flighty and ungrounded. It gives you the sweetness of life and all of its experiences should you choose to step into authenticity. I look forward to our coming together. \nPeace & Blessings ~ Gayathri Shylesh",

We see a church that turns careers into callings, and conversations into moments where you sense the Holy Spirit. We see a church that seeks to see Jesus and allows the Creator to create with His most prized possession; us. \n\nYou're invited to the journey, where we seek first the Kingdom and righteousness, and trust that He can add all things in His time.

Statistics say that 1 woman out of 5 has experience some type of sexual assault and 1 out of 3 between the ages of 11 & 17. Statistics also show that 1 out of 4 men experience some type of sexual abuse in their lifetime and the same ratio as women for young men between the ages of 11 & 17. We all can find statistics in various places, and these can also be different; but you know what? We are not a number, we are human beings who know that we are part of these groups of people who are the making of the stats. We are humans, we are men and women who want to belong to something else other than statistics. We are individuals who need to not feel lonely, alone, ashamed, fearful, abandoned and forgotten. This podcast is for you, for my fellow humans who feel the deepest feelings that sexual abuse has brought to our lives. You are not alone and although I can't promise that you will feel better after listening to this podcast, I feel enormous hope that you will find in these stories some comfort in knowing that you are never alone and that better times are to come.\nemail: powerinsurviving@gmail.com ",

        "description": "MINE is a podcast about reclaiming YOU. \n\nYour time. Your life. Your perspective.\n\nHOW MUCH OF YOUR TIME TRULY BELONGS TO YOU?\n\nMINE is for kind-hearted people who want more control over their lives. It\u2019s for people who tend to be overly generous with their Time, Energy and Attention and who want more Sovereignty, Power and Agency.\n\nMy name is Debbie Happy Cohen and I'm the founder of Joy-Based Living. Joy is made possible when you truly value yourself. Your beauty, your intelligence, your preciousness, your power. Have you ever seen children in a playground having fun? Young children intuitively know that they are precious and powerful. As an adult, your power is in the choices you make. And your calendar is where the rubber meets the road.\nTake ownership of your life by creating a great relationship with your calendar.\n\nMINE isn\u2019t about adding pressure to your life, it\u2019s about removing the obstacles to the joy that\u2019s in you which is meant to flow freely. \n\nWhen your joy is set free, your creativity will increase, you will carry yourself with authentic authority, and you will attract truly rewarding relationships. In every area of your life.\n\nI hope this podcast inspires you to create more joy in your life. YOU deserve it!",

All healing is from GOD. Each week, we will explore the right way to heal FROM wrong attitude TO the right attitude. A corrupt or bad soil cannot yield good fruit/food. This is the very bases for many disciplines advocating for more organic produce. When there is a disturbance in the bodies state of ease or comfort, don\u2019t we end with dis-ease. Science teaches that all organ systems, including the skin function to maintain homeostasis. Imbalance leads to disorder which results in disease. The word dis-ease was first used to literally refer to lack of ease or comfort. The prefix \u2018dis\u2019 simply references the state of lack or disequilibrium. Thus, the simplest definition of healing is the process of putting at ease. Whether you are see a medical doctor, a psychiatrist, a spiritual healer or not, everyone needs healing.

But the word, \"heretic\" comes from the Latin meaning, \"to choose,\" and is \"an opinion which disagrees with or conflicts with those who generally accept something as being authoritative, proper, or correct.\" In other words, a Heretic is a person who has applied their own intellect and experience of the world to emerge with a Truth that explains the Universe. This is a long-winded way of stating that, at Heretics Unite!, we explore that space which may diverge from the teachings of your childhood Sunday School teacher about the God, traditions, myths and purpose of Judaism. Join us each episode and listen with an open mind to see what feels right and what is still not quite there for you.

Through some simple techniques to change how we interact in the world such as surrender and clearing, we can align ourselves to our most natural conscious state where miracles abound. This is how we enter the Tao, and it's not just a way to garner miracles, but to live in the flow in an open dialog with the substrate of our birth. We can't force miracles to happen, but we maximize their playing field and remain open. They will arrive!</p><p>Host Sarrah Powell has humbly claimed more miracles than the average person, and began to notice similarities in the circumstances of many of her miracles. 5 kinds of miracles would show up repeatedly. The guiding and steering miracles finally revealed how to work with our miracle nature and a floodgate opened for daily synchronicities, abundance, healing, and perfect manifestations..</p><p>Combining a 30 year spiritual practice with the same amount of time on a miracle journey, while putting most of her miracles through the scientific process, Sarrah shares how everyone can align to their miracle nature.</p><p>The results have been astounding - our miracles tangibly demonstrate that Universe, God, Divine Spirit- whatever your believe - is powerful, precise, timely and always working in our favor, as it steers us to our highest good and just possibly, our soul purpose..

Mindfulness, meditation, breathing, calming, grounding techniques and motivation are all utilized. The foundation of Reigning In Light is peace. The core of it, is acceptance. And the intention of it, is to welcome the spirit to guide us. Reigning In Light looks at members of the human species as both a unique individual and a being with similar desires and characteristics to others with a need to not only contribute to the whole but gain from it as well. Reigning In Light is meant to be food for the soul and is filled with metaphors and analogies. It is a unification tactic with the universe. It is a remembrance of our inner connectivity to the earth and beyond. Reigning In light supports the straightening of our crown and the walking with our heads held high. It is not a replacement for therapy. The podcast begins with an introductory pilot that is more meditative than the subsequent episodes, which are topic based and an idea of spiritual health. It is a partner in solitude, a moment of gratitude and a challenger of isolation.</p><p>At this time, listeners can expect new episodes once per week.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.reigninginlight.org\">www.reigninginlight.org</a></p><p>Subscribe, like, share and comment on:</p><p>Youtube:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ReigningInLight\">https://www.youtube.com/@ReigningInLight</a></p><p>Follow me at:</p><p>Facebook:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092187452316\">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092187452316</a></p><p>Instagram:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reigninginlight/\">https://www.instagram.com/reigninginlight/</a></p><p></p><p>Twitter:</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ReigningInLight\">https://twitter.com/ReigningInLight</a></p><p></p><p>TikTok:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.tiktok.com/@reigninginlight\">www.tiktok.com/@reigninginlight</a></p><p></p><p>Original music Reigning In Light by Mojo Wired.</p><p>\u00a9 2023 R.L.B., Reign, Reigning In Light.

Ultimately, if you who want to break free from the grind of life, find your power, and start living a life of synchronistic adventure, this is for you!</p><p>The format of this podcast will be a mix of personal experiences, thought provoking concepts and interviews with like-minded souls.</p><p><strong>Who is Adam Leonard: </strong>I am man in his early 40's and I have always had a burning curiosity about the meaning of life and human potential. My life path has taken many turns, but my innate spiritual being led to develop my natural psychic talents. Consequently,<strong> </strong>I have worked as a Psychic Medium professionally for over 20 years, performing on Live TV and in a variety of events. However, I was always more interested in helping people overcome their problems and grow, so I decided to qualify as a Counsellor Hypnotherapist and have been bringing these skills into my work for over 10 years. Eventually, I wanted to make more of an impact, so I became a Qualified Teacher and upgraded my knowledge with a Masters in Psychology. However, Teaching became more about satisfying the Curriculum's agenda than helping children grow.</p><p><strong>My mission: </strong>Over the last few years I have decided to reach a larger audience and branched out online. I have developed a Soul Growth Coaching business that specialises in helping people live authentic spiritually fulfilling lives, full of growth and synchronistic adventure, and that is my intention with this podcast.</p>",

I want to help people who aren't fully satisfied with their lives and who want more from life.</p><p>If you experience lack in your life, whether financial, emotional, in relationships, or just struggling with emotional stuff that's affecting your life, then this podcast could potentially help you out. I've managed to overcome some pretty tough situations &amp; experiences, and it's purely been possible because of all the content I've consumed over the years, and that's what I'd like to give back, practical ways of improving your experiences and overcoming obstacles holding you back.</p><p>Any form of personal experience takes time and on this podcast I'm not going to give you methods to manifest your desires in 3 days etc., but rather to give you guidance and mental strength to pursue what you want, preparing you personally to match the vibration of what you want in the long run.

The Ocheti Sakowin is the Seven Council Fires, which is made up of the Dakhota, Lakhota and Nakhota Oyates.</p><p>The Moccasin Telegraph is about truth telling. If I, or any one on the podcast miseducates, please let us know. We want the information going out to be based in truth. Following the ways of our ancestors in speaking with respect and honor.</p><p>Education of the history of our land-based cultures past, present, and future is essential to re-Indigenizing the Ocheti Sakowin Oyate and The Moccasin Telegraph will be part of that education. Along with that education, The Moccasin Telegraph podcast will delve into topics that address food sovereignty, watersheds, microbes, ecosystems, historical trauma, mental health education, housing, education, oral and written language, equine therapy, treaties, land base/back, being a citizen of the Ocheti Sakowin, homelessness, the Ocheti Sakowin governance system, child development and parenting, to name a few. The idea is to share The Moccasin Telegraph podcast on the internet, radio stations, classrooms, with families and one another. We will involve relatives who will share their knowledge, stories and skills. The Moccasin Telegraph may eventually bring in video stories and video podcasts but will begin with it in audio form. We have an incredible culture to teach and bring forth to help in bringing back health to all our relatives.</p><p>Our culture has thrived and endured hardships for tens of thousands of years and I give thanks and appreciation to those relatives before me. I am proud to say I am Lakota and Nakota! Let us come together with good hearts and open minds to heal. Pilamaye lo!</p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>A BIBLICAL PERSPECTIVE on ghosts, UFOs, Bigfoot, cryptids, demons, angels, psychics, magic, miracles, and other paranormal high strangeness.</strong></p><p>Why a Christian podcast about stranger things? Yes, there are many crucial topics for us to ponder and engage, such as evangelism, sanctification, outreach, and discipleship. However, there are often situations in which less important side issues sneak up from behind and bite the more important ones. Although the supernatural is just one component among many others in a biblical worldview, it's becoming increasingly evident that unbiblical paranormal beliefs are significantly altering the worldviews of our society and of many Bible-believing Christians. The pop-culture paranormal makes people question what they've believed to be true, which ultimately leads many to question the integrity of God's Word. Worldview matters, and when worldviews change, there will be tangible consequences to evangelism, discipleship, and faith in general. \"God and the Paranormal\" takes an in-depth look at what \"experiencers\" claim and how the phenomena interact with scriptural truth.</p><p>See YouTube versions for pic, notes, charts,,,</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://ThinkingAboutTheBible.com\">ThinkingAboutTheBible.com</a></p><p>Email: godandtheparanormal@gmail.com</p>",

Yes, we are a small group of individuals who want to see change on our planet Terra (Earth) and we are well aware that for change to happen on Earth, we must first change ourselves, change the way we were programmed to THINK, change the way we interact with our communities and society in general. Our planet needs our help with her Ascension process, even though she WILL ascend to a high frequency with or without US Earthlings! One thing we do know is that for US as individuals to ascend with our planet, we too must begin our own ascension process of evolution and this is where this podcast comes in play in your life, we have the information to help guide you on your way so stay tuned to each podcast episode! If you are a truth seeker, going through a spiritual awakening, feel like your going crazy? Your Not! Our entire Galaxy and Solar system is going through an evolutionary period in this NEW age of Aquarius predicted and prophesied by great scholars and spiritualists since ancient times. Our mission is to help guide you along your journey to absolute truth by sharing the knowledge we have gained in our lifetime thus far.

Publicado em 1995, faz parte da s\u00e9rie \"A Vida no Mundo Espiritual\". O livro aborda temas relacionados \u00e0 obsess\u00e3o espiritual e seus impactos na vida das pessoas.</p><p>Feito de pain\u00e9is que retratam obsess\u00f5es, este livro resume diversos estudos sobre essa palpitante quest\u00e3o, especialmente procurando demostrar como, ao lado do desequil\u00edbrio emocional causado pelos perturbadores do Al\u00e9m-t\u00famulo, a tuberculose mais facilmente se manifesta em raz\u00e3o do bombardeio sofrido pelos macr\u00f3fagos, degenerados pela cont\u00ednua a\u00e7\u00e3o mental leviana do pr\u00f3prio paciente e, tamb\u00e9m, decorrente da intoxica\u00e7\u00e3o por sucessivas ondas mentais desagregadoras do seu perseguidor, favorecendo, assim, a instala\u00e7\u00e3o e virul\u00eancia do bacilo de Koch, com as consequ\u00eancias compreens\u00edveis em quadro de tal natureza. Outrossim, examinamos ocorr\u00eancias variadas, nas quais a obsess\u00e3o se encontra presente, bem como as t\u00e9cnicas e terapias espirituais aplicadas, nem sempre aceitas ou assimiladas pelos enfermos de ambos os lados da vida. Fazemos votos de que estas p\u00e1ginas encontrem resson\u00e2ncia nos que padecem de obsess\u00f5es, auxiliando-os a desvencilhar-se da cruel ocorr\u00eancia, ao mesmo tempo em que possam contribuir com algum subs\u00eddio \u00fatil aos que as estudam, no que diz respeito ao concurso dos abnegados instrutores espirituais, que trabalham afanosamente em prol do progresso da criatura humana e do planeta que nos serve de domic\u00edlio e oportunidade de crescimento interior.</p><p>Produ\u00e7\u00e3o: EM Lives TV.</p><p>Realiza\u00e7\u00e3o: Projeto Espiritismo e Mediunidade.</p><p>M\u00eddias Sociais:</p><p>Site - <a href=\"https://emlives.tv\">https://emlives.tv</a></p><p>Facebook - <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/espiritismoemediunidade\">https://www.facebook.com/espiritismoemediunidade</a></p><p>Instagram - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/espiritismo.mediunidade\">https://www.instagram.com/espiritismo.mediunidade</a></p><p>Twitter - <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emediunidade\">https://twitter.com/emediunidade</a></p><p>YouTube - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/espiritismoemediunidade\">https://www.youtube.com/espiritismoemediunidade</a></p><p>TikTok - <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@espiritismoemediunidade\">https://www.tiktok.com/@espiritismoemediunidade</a></p>",

        "description": "<p>Hello everyone, welcome to From Religion to Self Podcast with your host Terry Malatji.</p><p><strong>Who is Terry Malatji?</strong></p><p>I am a life coach, spiritual teacher, author &amp; educator of Principles &amp; Tools of Creation. I am also a founder of Life with Terry - a coaching, wellness, &amp; education company established to help people create &amp; live a fulfilled life, create effectively &amp; efficiently , and embark on a life journey of Self-discovery, Self-development &amp; Self-healing.</p><p><strong>PURPOSE OF PODCAST</strong></p><p>This podcast was created to talk about religion, indoctrination, colonisation and brain washing &amp; reversal thereof. I use the word <em>Self </em>to refer to the original version of the body, the spirt, mind and soul before colonisation, indoctrination and brain washing caused by religion.</p><p>I was indoctrinated, colonised and brainwashed for decades by Christian religion, from the time I was born until 2019 when I embarked on a beautiful journey of Self-discovery, Self-development &amp; Self-healing. Since then I have never looked back.</p><p>The decolonisation of the faith-based religion, surprisingly led to further decolonisation of multiple non-faith based religions and human made systems that unfortunately limit our abilities to find and manifest Self.</p><p>This podcast is one of the platforms that I will use to manifest the undeniable deep calling of sharing my journey, enlightening &amp; healing others as we raise the individual &amp; collective consciousness of the human race. The podcast will help you create &amp; live a fulfilled life, create effectively &amp; efficiently, embark on life journey of Self-discovery, Self-development &amp; Self-healing.</p><p>There is no better time than now. What a time to be alive, in the presence of a powerful force filled with the energy of truth &amp; healing of human race.</p><p>The ultimate goal of this podcast is to help my non-indoctrinated listeners to understand the impact of religion on a human being &amp; find better ways to relate with those who are indoctrinated. It is also to enlighten my listeners who are colonised and brainwashed, to remember who they are, heal &amp; restore themselves from multiple traumas caused by religion.</p><p>May you find healing, freedom, peace, joy, happiness, love, health, light &amp; every positive energy that you can think, raise your consciousness of as we embark on this beautiful journey together. May you connect with Self and become the creator that you are destined to become.</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://www.lifewithterry.com\">https://www.lifewithterry.com</a></p><p><strong>NB! </strong>Please note that episodes 3-8 were moved from the Podcast Life with Terry @ <a href=\"https://rss.com/podcasts/lifewithterry/\">https://rss.com/podcasts/lifewithterry/</a>.</p><p>We are also pleased to announce that we have a new Podcast dedicated to the subject matter of Principles &amp; Tools of Creation.
