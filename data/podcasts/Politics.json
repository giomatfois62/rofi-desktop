Environmental devastation?  Labor precarity?  Alienation?  We pick a different societal plague each week and talk with an expert about how that plague makes the coronavirus deadlier. \n</p> \n\n     We then move on to discuss \u201ctreatments\u201d or even \u201ccures\u201d for that plague: what kinds of political or cultural action we can take to \u201ccure\u201d it.  Since many of our guest experts are also artists, they are invited to share a creative work on the topic\u2014a song, poem, monologue\u2014of their own creation or choosing.\n</p>\n\n     Guests include poet and Friends of the Earth organizer Jeff Conant, Dr. Rupa Marya of the Do No Harm Coalition and the band Rupa and the April Fishes, performance artists Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, theatre activist Aryeh Shell, affordable medicine activist Merith Basey, playwright and San Francisco Mime Troupe member Michael Gene Sullivan, and many more.\n</p>\n\n     Your host, L.M.

The pulpit was a place where religious tradition mixed with political philosophy. If it were not for strong men of God, who were unafraid to speak outwardly about their faith and take strong political stands, this country would not be what it is today. Sadly, most Pastor\u2019s do not see the importance of keeping their church body informed politically. Tom does not subscribe to this philosophy. He believes it is extremely important to share the Gospel, Win the Lost, Disciple Believers, and to keep the church informed of what is going on politically so that we can \u201cresist\u201d the devil\u2019s schemes and plans.</p>",

We zijn verbonden met elkaar door kunst, maar ook door eten en gezelligheid.\n\nWe verbinden op een laagdrempelige manier de onderwerpen en theorie\u00ebn die ons inspireren met het alledaagse en herkenbare. We werken vanuit de overtuiging dat kunst ons kan helpen om na te denken over nieuwe manieren om de wereld te bekijken en in te richten. Graag gaan we zelfs nog een stap verder dan hierover nadenken, en proberen we de idee\u00ebn die we bespreken ook dagelijks in de praktijk te brengen. We verzetten ons tegen de patriarchale norm die in onze maatschappij nog steeds leidend is, en stellen in plaats daarvan collectiviteit, waardering, zorg, overleg en emotie centraal. Daarbij haken we aan op actuele onderwerpen, zoals kapitalisme, feminisme en digitale cultuur, en zijn we niet bang om mee te veranderen met de tijd.",

        "description": "<p>Politics Under the Microscope captures the thought process of policy makers as they respond to complex problems and to discuss the implications those policies will have for the scientific community and broader society. Each episode starts by briefing the listener on a societal problem using an anecdote, then will reframe the problem with a science policy-related question, and finally engage the listener by integrating audio from multiple expert interviews. Taken together, these will shape the role science can and may play in developing policies in response to political and social issues. Our unique approach lies in our ability to layer scientific and political facts in a single narrative, with an emphasis on capturing the principles of scientific and creative problem solving to address a diverse range of topics that caters to many interests.

        "description": "Wei\u00df-Rot-Wei\u00df. Freiheit im Wandel. Der neue Podcast aus Berlin zu Belarus von Karoline Gil und Patryk Szostak. \n\nIn wenigen Wochen wird die Er\u00f6ffnung der neuen Ausstellung des Pilecki-Instituts Berlin \u00fcber die Proteste und aktuelle Lage in Belarus stattfinden. Begleitend dazu, erscheint zun\u00e4chst eine neue Podcast-Reihe.\n\nAngesichts der nicht erst seit den gef\u00e4lschten Pr\u00e4sidentschaftswahlen am 9.August regelm\u00e4\u00dfig stattfindenden Massenproteste gegen Alexander Lukashenkas Regime, w\u00e4re man eigentlich geneigt zu sagen \u201eIm Osten viel Neues\u201c, um einen Klassiker zu paraphrasieren. Die Menschen gehen auf die Stra\u00dfen, weil sie der Korruption, Staatswillk\u00fcr und der fehlenden Meinungsfreiheit eine Absage erteilen. Seit Beginn der Proteste wurden bereits \u00fcber 40.000 Menschen verhaftet, gefoltert oder anderweitig misshandelt und erniedrigt. Sie sehen sich mit einer Mischung aus Repressalien und Erm\u00fcdung konfrontiert, denen der Westen nur Halbherziges entgegenzusetzen wei\u00df.\n\nAnders als letztes Jahr war davon in den letzten Monaten leider nicht mehr viel in den Medien zu sp\u00fcren \u2013 eine Art Grundskepsis hat sich breit gemacht, bedingt durch fehlende Aussichten auf schnellen Erfolg, die Annahme, dass man ob der geopolitischen Verh\u00e4ltnisse ohnehin nur \u00fcber begrenzte Handlungsoptionen verf\u00fcgt oder dass es sich bei Belarus ohnehin nur um ein m\u00e4\u00dfig bedeutsames, weil weit entfernt liegendes Land handelt.\n \nKaroline Gil und Patryk Szostak wollen sich damit nicht abfinden und hinterfragen diese Annahmen, indem sie  Expert:innen, Belarus:innen, internationale Beobachter:innen und Politiker:innen zu Wort lassen. Dass es dabei teils auch zu unterschiedlichen Einsch\u00e4tzungen kommt, liegt in der Natur der Sache, aber in einem herrscht Einigkeit: Es w\u00e4re ein Trugschluss zu glauben, dass die Marginalisierung des Themas in der \u00d6ffentlichkeit realen au\u00dfenpolitischen Gegebenheiten und Verh\u00e4ltnissen entspricht. Ganz im Gegenteil. \n\nDavon war auch der erste Gast bei \u201eWei\u00df-Rot-Wei\u00df\u201c, der Journalist und Publizist Richard Herzinger \u00fcberzeugt, welcher in einem seiner Artikel folgendes konstatierte: \u201eBelarus, das sind wir\u201c. Zusammen mit ihm wollten wir zun\u00e4chst der fundamentalen Frage \u201eWarum?\u201c auf den Grund gehen:\n\nWarum ist Belarus f\u00fcr den Westen wichtig?",

        "description": "Using several years of research by youth-led organization Teens for Peace in the Middle East, this miniseries seeks to uncover the opinions, ideas, and experiences of teenagers caught in the middle of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and use the words of teenagers to craft suggestions for the future of youth peacebuilding in the Middle East. Each episode highlights one question asked by host, 17-year-old Max Hyman from Chicago, to each of over 30 teens from Israel and/or Palestine in interviews and dissects many of the responses and what they reveal over the successes and failures of the peacebuilding system. Episodes end with conclusions from these discoveries and focus on the importance of listening to teen voices. Teens for Peace in the Middle East, founded in 2020, was built by a team of teens looking to make a difference by creating a network of connected teens for a more peaceful future in Israel and Palestine that values the voices of youth, who are young enough to reverse permanent and harmful stereotypes and opinions. In addition to over 30 interviews, teenspeace.org features educational materials for teens to learn about the conflict from an unbiased perspective, and Teens for Peace in the Middle East hosts panels and discussions. The organization is currently planning a PeaceSummit event and is conducting professional research on the successes and failures of the peacebuilding system.",

        "description": "<p>Hello universe!</p><p>How's it going?</p><p>Ok. Ok! I get it. Dumb question.</p><p>At least on v.867-5309 Earth it is. This updated timeline we're all running now is a legitimate flustercuck. Wherever one cares to look, things are getting worse. And the worst part of all?</p><p>This mess we're all snared in with its momentous culminations at this precise point in time?</p><p>Well, that's mostly on me for failing to recognize long ago that living my life with the purpose and destiny I intended when I manifested here wasn't a choice for only my amusement.</p><p>Nope. Not. Even. Close.</p><p>As it turns out, my destiny has almost nothing to do with my own life experiences and everything to do with how much help I can offer you.</p><p>And offer to you, and to you too.</p><p>And to these ladies on my left, as well as those two guys right there and to all of those kids playing up there. As well as any other homo sapien sapiens who are here needing my help.</p><p>Whether you're an eternal soul tapping into the infinite source's wisdom, or an interplanetary interloper investigating intriguing incidents involving impossible internal incisions, or an arch-angel of biblical lore (fallen or ascending, no judgement here), or a Lemurian light-being, a Pleiadean/Annunaki hybrid starseed. You might even be a silver surfer on acid teaching taekwondo in Tahiti.</p><p>Totally.</p><p>All are welcome.</p><p>Even you. Yes you. You who wrongly thinks you're nothing but a 21st century homo sapien sapien living a pointless life here on Earth v.867-5309. A life that you hope ends peacefully as you sleep.</p><p>You might have been born in Ogunquit, Maine but are now living with your Aunt Sandy in Keene, New Hampshire so you can save money while working part time at a car wash in Brattleboro, Vermont, all of which allows you to finish up your MBA at the university in Framingham, Massachusetts.</p><p>Could that be you? Manifesting now with me here? Collectively experiencing these collapsing particles riding out their wave potentials to destinations as of now, undetermined?</p><p>Because your participation and specific contribution on this timeline is what starts turning this thing around. In fact much of what's broken now will only get worse if you don't rise up to fulfill your life's unique purpose.</p><p>Yes. You.</p><p>Given the situation, I can't escape one basic thought:</p><p>\"WtF is going wrong now?\"</p><p>Usually followed by a:</p><p>\"Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse...\"</p><p>moment.</p><p>Which inevitably gives rise to thoughts like:</p><p>\"If they'll take it to this level what won't they do?!??\"</p><p>Unmoored by all the chaos, now the internal muttering starts up:</p><p>\"I just don't know any more. I mean ... who's going to fix all this? ... and how? The one thing I do know is this kind of mess won't fix itself. We're gonna need some help around here. I think we might even be running out of time to do something about it... If I'm being totally honest.\"</p><p>Yeah, yeah, call me out for my late start on the project. I deserve it.</p><p>I admit that I should have gotten this going way before January 2, 2022. However, starting things at the last possible second is kind of my thing.</p><p>That said, when I do show up, I come prepared to work with concentrated purpose until the job's 100% completed.</p><p>Come join me if you are so inclined, but do so with at least a 1.5x uptick in playback speed. You'll thank me later for all the time saved.</p><p>I add to my nonsense daily, or at least I try to. If I'm absent for a day or two it's nothing to be concerned about. I likely broke another phone or fell victim to some other equally unglamorous event. I'll return sooner or later... probably later.</p><p>Much like yourself I still have some of life's crossroads left to navigate. Many lessons to learn. Many people to meet. In doing so, I promise not to forego any life rewards I've yet to experience!</p><p>And neither should you!</p>",

Afterward, a friendship was born. Now they share a mic to fight for freedom of truth, freedom to worship God our creator, and freedom to otherwise acknowledge everything mainstream media doesn't! They don't claim to have ALL the answers and they're not preachers, pastors, or priests. Just a couple guys who believe in doing what's right.

You can learn more about that right here: https://linktr.ee/awaresocialmedia\n\nI focus on creating effective branding and messaging for people and communities who are often left out of mainstream marketing. Part of that mission involves having a keen understanding of social awareness...and in my case, that meaning is twofold.\n\nWhy is it so important to properly and effectively represent LGBTQ+ people and all people who might be considered \"other\" in society? Because being represented by someone who looks and IS like you\u2014someone who shares your experiences\u2014makes a difference. It makes you feel seen, heard, and understood for who you are as an individual\u2026not just as a member of a group. When we feel seen, our self-esteem rises; we feel empowered; we have more confidence in ourselves and our abilities. And that confidence translates into success: career advancement, higher paychecks (if you're working), better relationships with friends and family members\u2026even better health outcomes!\n\nLet me be clear, however, that I know I do not speak for everyone. I may be bisexual, but I am still an able-bodied, cisgender, white male. This platform is intended to create a space for people from many diverse communities to come together and share their stories, businesses, and to discuss topics relating to social media and representation.

Hosted by Adam Ellwanger, a professor of rhetoric at the University of Houston - Downtown, the show features professors, administrators, and students who have unique ideas about how to restore intellectual culture -- whether inside institutional settings or out of them. Each episode focuses on the same 3 questions, asked of every guest (in addition to other questions): 1) How did the decline of the American university occur? 2) Can the American university be rehabilitated? 3) If it can be rehabilitated, how? If it cannot be rehabilitated, then what is to be done?",

We view mental health in a state a public health crisis caused by the collective trauma of capitalism. The mental health industry in the US largely serves to uphold capitalist power structures and manage reactions to capitalist oppression. The series starts off with an overview and discussion of the book Psychiatric Hegemony which critiques the power structure of mental health professionals and the profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry. Future discussions may center around teach ins, collective trauma, public mental health education, community mental health, personal experiences, scientific research, mental health behaviors, neurodiversity, or other topics related to liberation from the current model of psychiatry.\n\nWhile we do recognize the pain and suffering at the individual level and that individuals have benefitted from interventions within the mental health care system, this podcast is best suited for individuals ready to critique the power structure and imagine the future of mental health from a revolutionary perspective. This podcast will touch high-level on many potentially triggering topics including but not limited to sexuality, violence, racism, misogyny, substance use, and any number of atrocities.",

We are unashamed of the truth, the gospel, and my personal logic and conservatism. This is not mere rebellion, but it is a fight. It is the logic, facts, and morals that are becoming an arsenal of weapons in this fight for truth and justice. This is coming from young people seeking the truth in order to ground our beliefs. So let\u2019s reject the lie that young people should be sheep who can\u2019t freely and intelligently think for ourselves, and let us seek truth to learn together what we believe and WHY we believe it.",

Throughout the past 70 years we have been a leading voice in the promotion of European unity and an early campaigner for key milestones in the development of the European Communities and then the European Union.\n\nWe believe that completing European economic and political unity is urgently required to ensure Europe\u2019s economic prosperity and relevance in a fast-changing world.  As federalists we are critical of the slow-pace and small-steps policy that impedes progress towards a greater European integration.  We consider nationalism, Euro-scepticism and passive acceptance of division as Europe's worst enemies. As federalists and voters we passionately call for a European democracy where European citizens - not just national governments - determine the policies of European government. The UEF promotes federalism as the optimum way to organise European unity in a way that is democratic and effective while preserving the diversity of our European countries.",

Voting your conscience is a way back to the power being in the hands of the people. With everyone picking one politician or another out of fear of the other side getting into power, be courageous and join me in voting for people that you would actually want to be our leaders. Voting your conscience can be implemented in elections at all levels of politics. It can also be used in day to day life. Every day you are casting votes for what companies and organizations you want to have more or less power in the future by using your dollars. Every time you spend money with a company, it is a vote for them to exist and have more power in the future. If you wouldn't want that company to have more power, simply don't hand over your hard earned purchasing power to them. This podcast is focused on the political system in the United States of America, but it's scope will reach much beyond politics. With the power of our country's government growing, it is reaching into our lives in ever increasing ways. I simply want that to stop. I want the power to be back in the people's hands as this country's founding was supposed to be. Come with me as we dissect why our country seems to be in a massive disconnect between the people and the government and what we can do about it.</p>",

A skilled storyteller, Dr. Stead studied at the Vermont Institute of Social Ecology and received his PhD at the Antioch New England School of Environmental Studies. This podcast follows his journey from boyhood, hunting and trapping in the Torne Valley of Ramapo where he first discovered Ford Motor Company\u2019s pollution of the watershed, and on to the culmination of a Forty-million-dollar clean-up. Along the way we are introduced to members of the Ramapough Lunaape Nation, as well as citizen scientists, archaeologists, herpetologists, engineers, politicians, journalists, and Dr. Steads students who experienced what it means to speak truth-to-power.

Hosted by <em>Donal Carroll,</em> <em>Critical Difference</em>, and fellow observational creative <em>Wolfgang</em>, each podcast focusses on a topical issue and aims to surprise, risk, challenge and make critical sense of it to start conversations that matter. And <em>What Lies Behind</em> will find ones that matter to you.</strong></p><p><strong>We will also draw attention to that unruly fuel , the trampoline of language - what goes up might not be what comes down! If you\u2019re interested in dancing with questions and how they can be tin-openers to sculpt new meaning from what\u2019s taken for granted, or if you want to see how much of your thinking is <em>actually your own,</em> come along. Be surprised! If you want something that\u2019s provocative and arresting, this is the perfect podcast for you.</strong></p>",

        "description": "<p><strong>What it's all about...</strong>I was inspired to create this podcast by the current Australian government\u2019s push for a referendum on an Indigenous voice to parliament (<em>The</em> Indigenous Voice). This show is about exposing the many Deadly Indigenous voices (<em>plural</em>) that exist between the Yes23 campaigners and the racist No voters and through conversations with a diverse range of everyday Indigenous Australians, political activists, politicians, lawyers, comedians, musicians etc we will learn why many Indigenous peoples are saying No (a progressive No) and offer alternatives to what many deem a symbolic and ultimately powerless voice to parliament. Of course after the referendum the show must go on and will continue to hear these deadly voices speaking truth to power and offer some important but not so popular views on Indigenous society, culture and politics in Australia.</p><p><strong>A bit about me...</strong>I am a 1971 model Biripi man from the mid-north coast of NSW. I have been working in Aboriginal education and media as a teacher and filmmaker for over 30 years. I hold a masters in film and documentary and am a Doctor of Creative Arts. I have produced over 20 broadcast programs for the ABC, NITV and have won some awards for my independent documentary film making. I have a passion for Indigenous social justice and truth telling and surround myself with people actively pursuing these same goals through their front-line activism, art, films, music and politics. I hope to have these deadly people on the show to engage with in some very <em>deadly </em>yarns. I am also a music lover and maker so the show will also feature some of my own as well as some of my favourite Indigenous Australian music.</p>",
