        "description": "Two Weeks from Tuesday co-creators, Aliya Bloom and Erynn Wakefield have always connected through music. Most of their friendship has been long distance and paired with their busy lives, it seemed to be a recipe for disaster. But, over the years, they have shared music as a way to reach out, keep in touch, and keep tabs on each other. Whether it was through collaborative playlists, seasonal playlists, or even a quick song here and there; Two Weeks From Tuesday is unique in its approach, serving as a podcast as well as a platform for new artists. And when they can\u2019t be live and talking to you, they\u2019re still with you through corresponding playlists made for their listeners for every episode. \n\nThis podcast truly wraps music and life into one entity and demonstrates how essential music is to the human experience. Most of all, Two Weeks From Tuesday aims to be honest. Co-creators, Aliya Bloom and Erynn Wakefield, truly want to reach out to their listeners with a helping hand and say, \u201cwe understand.\u201d \n",

        "title": "The Gen-Spec Fashion Cast",
        "description": "<p>Like it or not, we live in a constantly-evolving culture that radically reassesses itself on an ongoing basis, then represents itself through its arts, culture, and media.</p><p>New ideas emerge, and once-sacred ideals that were thought to comprise an unchanging cultural bedrock seemingly come under threat - however, not in the form of a promise of impending violence. Rather, felt through inevitable growing pains of society in constant flux where resistance against the current would be within stark contravention to the past and any of its precedents:</p><p>Change was always the constant.</p><p>Look no further than the rapid development of the popular style of dress as evidence to this effect.</p><p>No matter where someone finds themselves on the modern-day spectral analysis of gender, or sex, or the terms used interchangeably, the past was true: throughout human history there were only a handful of instances where cultures allowed their views to penetrate the established order of gender dichotomy between man or woman. A new mode of consciousness is seeping into modern culture, particularly in the West that seeks to blur the lines between the two forms, but historically the opposite was primarily the case, and this is the area in which fashion has predominated accordingly.</p><p>With that said, it doesn't matter where someone finds themselves on the gender spectrum in regards to their fashion, except where they intersect with the old ideas separating men and women by their clothing. This rift essentially forced the Gen-Spec Fashion Cast into existence, speaking solely through love and in peace.</p><p></p><p>My name is Elliott, founder, editor and lead design for Lambdog. I identify as a man, and will be using the terms \"man\" and \"woman\" in the ways they have been known colloquially.</p><p>When I entered the world of fashion, the first thing I noticed was that it was a field nearly entirely devoted to women. It was for women, by women; it was women talking to other women and there was a markedly enthusiastic and compassionate tone in regards to their communication. It was clearly a community.</p><p></p><p>I soon realized how little I knew about the subject, and you may find yourself in this camp as well, but that didn't stop me from encroaching upon the topic in any way that I found useful, including Udemy courses, other podcasts, fashion magazines, Youtube videos, fashion shows, as well as discussions with some of the amazing women in my own life.</p><p>I had no idea that something that had such a vast living and breathing culture and undercurrent would be so dramatically obscured from the mainstream point of view, outside of those who went looking for it. At best, I could merely observe from afar. My goal was not to pattern-disrupt (borrowing from my education in marketing), I simply wanted to watch the beautiful thing go.</p><p></p><p>As a man in the way that I refer to it, an interest in this subject takes on an interesting tilt. While there are clearly plenty of men who participate in this field, they tend to not fit the stereotypical bill - which nobody really cares about anyway.</p><p>Speaking personally, I certainly have no male friends that I can go to and talk about fashion with, and most of the men I know only consider their clothing choices after-the-fact. Despite the massive communicative ability a person carries with them in their clothing, there is a substantial portion of men who simply refuse to have any participation in the subject, although, happily, it seems like some of those barriers have begun to weaken for some time now.</p><p>I want to welcome you to the Gen-Spec Podcast - an ongoing analysis of everything relating to the fashion world in its current manifestations through the lens of a self-identifying man, an artist, a creator - a profiler. A scribe, my knowledge base lies primarily within language and writing, but I didn't start a clothing design company simply so I could write about it.</p>",
