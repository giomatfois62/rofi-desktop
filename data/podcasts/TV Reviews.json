When she wanted to talk about being South Asian socially, she was met with a lot of enthusiasm about butter chicken, arranged marriage, and Slumdog Millionaire (\u201cJai Ho!\u201d) At 30, she decided enough was enough\u2014she would awaken from her denial, embrace her identity, and dive deeper in its psychology, and how to heal oneself to show up better for sister communities. Now, on this podcast, Lahari talks with every day, badass brown women and allies, about topics that were often avoided.

This podcast is designed to be a deep dive critical film analysis on children's media as well as entertaining every time. I designed this podcast for fans of the shows, new parents who are raising their children with intention, people who are so busy they can't keep up with watching everything but want to be able to talk about it, and for the people in my life to have a place to talk about our favorite films. What makes me qualified to talk about this? Well for starters, I grew up as a traumatized kid, so I know what not to do as a parent. Also since I was healing from my neglectful childhood, I learned a lot about trauma and life along the way. I am also a SAG-AFTRA actress with her own production company living in Los Angeles so I know what makes a good film and what it takes to make it.  You might have also noticed that unlike other podcasts, my episode art changes. I have a lot of pictures from my creative work, so I make the episode art an actual art piece inspired by the film. Pretty cool, huh? I hope you enjoy listening and you can reach me at any of the links below in the episodes. Thanks for listening!",

        "description": "Many of you may know me as an actress in Michael Crichton\u2019s Premier film \u201cWestworld\u201d in which I played Arlette, robot prostitute who seduced & gave favors to Richard Benjamin. Now Richard was a fantastic actor to work with especially because he knew I was uncomfortable having to disrobe and undress. \n\nRichard might have been uncomfortable during that scene but I never noticed a hint of it. Off-screen he was a happily married man to a beautiful and highly talented actress Paula Prentiss, known for her comedy roles in many films. \n\nI\u2019d like to mention that when actors don't have any lines of dialogue, it\u2019s not as easy as you would think. Without words, the character has little to work with. As an audience, think about it and imagine what or how You would convey your thoughts to another person if you were unable to speak. Well, if you don\u2019t agree, try it sometime. It isn\u2019t easy my friends. \n\nAlso, it was inferred that handsome James Brolin was having his way with another saloon gal. FYI - As an aside, James Brolin is married to the iconic \u201cOut of this World\u201d Singer, Actress, Award-Winning Barbra Streisand. \n\nMeanwhile, Brolin's character was being pursued by the Man in Black, Gunslinger Yul Brynner who was brilliant, outstanding, and very scary. Mr. Brynner was best known for being the staunch King in the legendary film \"The King and I\" with Award-Winning actress Deborah Kerr.  \n\nNow regarding television, there was a well-known series called The Green Hornet (Green Hornet Music.. )in which you may know me as VAMA, the One and Only woman in history to \"ZAP\" the Great, Incomparable Bruce Lee as CATO.  During and between \"takes\" Bruce and I would talk at length about so many things but honestly He did most of the talking. He said he didn't easily open up to others but felt like he'd known me for a long time. That he felt safe & very comfortable. \n\nIn The Batman 66 series (Batman Music)  I was The Riddler's female villain \"MOTH\". I will be giving fans much to chew on when talking about the show's Hero Adam West, his sidekick Burt Ward and the forever Memorable Frank Gorshin. Certainly More to share at another time. \n\nThere are a slew of many other series such as Bewitched with Elizabeth Mongomery and Dick York, Lost in Space, Bonanza, and my Introductory and very first role in Ben Casey as well as many other roles in which I guest-starred.\n",

From the outside, Italy has often been considered a white society that has been rapidly changing due to immigration, so Italians are faced with a new representation of their country. I aim to explore how televised programming deals with this shift, and I will pay specific attention to minority youth. Through the exploration of five series, I have gathered different presentations of racially/diverse youth in Italian television and how their presences are dealt within these shows. I will address the right to representation for these racial/diverse groups, the depiction of their bodies, and whether these televised programs aim to educate an evolving society. ",

It's more than just a show, it's almost a way of life. Hardcore fans, like hosts Nick Konarowski and Shane Lynch, know all the episodes, lines and characters. But is it really as good as we remember it? Or is the powerful drug of nostalgia washing over us, making it seem better than it was? Nick and Shane aim to find out, by going back to the beginning. They start with a rating based on memories and following a real-time watch-through, they discuss if it was better or worse than they recall. Plus, they talk about a bunch of other stuff in life @simpsons_EBE New Episodes Every FRIDAY! Donate&gt; https://www.buymeacoffee.com/simpsonsEBE</p>",
