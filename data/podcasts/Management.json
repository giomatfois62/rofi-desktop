        "title": "10 Things You Should Know about Stakeholder Capitalism",
        "description": "In 2019, the Business Roundtable announced that the purpose of business was no longer to maximize profits for shareholders.  The new purpose of business would be to maximize value for stakeholders.  While the announcement was applauded by many, charges of hypocrisy quickly followed as the practices of many Business Roundtable member companies suddenly seemed to contradict the new more egalitarian purpose they had proclaimed.\n\nA year later, if anything is becoming clear, it is that what the world is coming to know as \u201cstakeholder capitalism\u201d, lacks a clear definition against which to assess the performance of a firm, or even an economy.\n \nThis lack of definition is not the result of a lack of attempts.  For years a wide variety of thought leaders and pioneering practitioners have been refining models and frameworks to define a new paradigm for business.  But none has broken into the mainstream.\n \nIn response to this situation, a team comprised of members from a variety of organizations working within the \u201cbusiness as a force for good\u201d movement attempted to create a common definition of the end-state they were all working to achieve.  Their work resulted in a brand-agnostic framework, endorsed by all, that identified six essential competencies of a business in the new paradigm.\n \nIn 10 binge-able episodes, this podcast will introduce, illustrate and popularize an ambitious and actionable definition for stakeholder capitalism.\n \nProducers/Hosts\nAmanda Kathryn Roman is a life-long convener and builder of infrastructure to scale a wide variety of movements you\u2019ve heard of, and some you have not.  Most recently she was the Chief Innovation Office for Conscious Capitalism where she joined the frenzy of activity happening all around the world to catalyze an expanded paradigm of capitalism.  In 2018, she and Nathan Havey co-founded the year-long, comprehensive certification program for consultants of Conscious Capitalism\n \nNathan Havey has been a leader of, participant-in content provider for, and strategic consultant to many of the major entities in the \u201cbusiness as a force for good movement\u201d.  A host and storyteller by training and passion, he has produced powerful live storytelling experiences in more than a dozen US cities and he wrote and directed the upcoming feature documentary Beyond Zero, and has been learning and refining a library.\n \nNathan and Amanda believe that each of the stories in this mini-series should be legend in business circles, and yet they are continually shocked to meet people, including some of the celebrity-status thought leaders and pioneering practitioners in their circles are unaware that these stories exist.  That must change.",

        "description": "We are leaders in a healthcare organization. Before COVID, our team which consists of RN\u2019s CNA\u2019s and psychosocial supports are field based healthcare workers and would pop in and out of the office during the day. After COVID, in an effort to reduce the spread, our doors have been closed to field staff, corporate leadership has been grounded from traveling to our offices and we needed a way to keep everyone motivated, engaged and connected. We have always started our day with a 15 minute morning team call, its primary purpose was to inform the team of any patient needs. After COVID, we needed to rethink how we have always done things and reinvent the utility of the morning call. We emerged with a call that provided motivation, support, encouragement, critical COVID updates, patient need updates, employee and team engagement, and strong leadership to help everyone see their way through this Global Crisis. What we happened upon was magic! For a team that pretty much turned over 75% in the early months of COVID, mainly due to personal circumstances, we needed to form and norm a team virtually. We would say we not only accomplished that goal, but THRIVED into one of the best, most cohesive teams we have ever been a part of. This podcast is about how we do it...",

It is clear that our citizens are no longer comfortable with the traditional approaches to addressing systemic challenges \u2013 i.e. ones that contain the \u201cright language and practices\u201d but are mostly symbolic and ultimately, yield slow, and often, insignificant change. \n\nAnd so, this podcast, The Equalizer Project was born. Through conversations with leaders who can share rich, complex, and powerful experiences of life in the corporate world, I hope to bring awareness, to heal, to inspire and to leave the audience with hope and a solution, yes, a solution! It is part of my calling or personal mission \u2013 to change lives and to leave others better off.\n\nThis is the work of The Equalizer Project.",

        "description": "THEBOARDCHECKUP explores the subject of board performance with leaders of nonprofit organizations around the world interested in nonprofit governance as well as those who used the online tool known as Board Checkup to self-assess board performance. \n\nIn Season 1, each episode is a case study profiling a different board and organization as well as trends in the external environment driving change in governance.  Board motivation for assessing performance is discussed along with change in the board and its impact on the organization. Each episode concludes with a summary of lessons learned and the elements that make each case a great love story.\n\nIn Season 2, the nine dimensions of board effectiveness assessed in the Board Checkup are explored with nonprofit leaders.  Each dimension assessed is defined theoretically. Next, drawing from the research, common issues that can challenge board effectiveness are discussed along with theories about why they exist, and change boards have implemented in response to them.   \n\nThe podcast will be of interest to board chairs, CEOS, and directors looking for accessible and affordable research-based tools and resources to measure, track, and develop in leadership and governance effectiveness. It will also be of interest to consultants working with boards as well as regulators and funders concerned about board accountability and impact. Finally, it will be of interest to faculty and students of nonprofit leadership looking for case studies that explore the complex nature of governance, the governance context in different cultures and countries, and the range of leadership roles and responsibilities boards and directors play in the organizations they govern.\n",

As I said, straight talking and authentic.\n\nAs I am still a registered Real Estate Agent (Licensee) I will also host solo shows where I talk about anything interesting in the industry and also share some recruitment tips and tricks if you are on the hunt for new per'sonnel' or on the hunt for a new job.\n\n\"Powered by sonnel Recruitment - Your per'sonnel' partner\".\n\nConnect or follow at \n- https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicdirosso/\n- hello@sonnelrecruitment.com.au\n- https://sonnelrecruitment.com.au/ \n- https://www.linkedin.com/company/sonnel-recruitment\n- https://www.youtube.com/@insidetheleadershipcryptex",

We support the city\u2019s underrepresented young people (18-30) to fulfil their creative ambitions and mobilise to affect radical social change through the arts. We are anti-establishment, fiercely independent and co-created with and for young people. \n\nThings need to change. The cultural and creative sectors are not fit-for-purpose. As our unique ways of working, thinking and facilitating become more recognised, we work both locally and nationally advocating for radical sector and cultural change through activist campaigns, research, consultation, care and our creative agency services. This podcast is our gift to you. \n\nWe hope you find a home here. Connect with us: \n\nhello@rising.org.uk &gt; join our mailing list\n@RisingArtsAgency (instagram) \n@RisingArtAgency (twitter)\n",

Think of it like a game where both sides want to win, but they also want to avoid losing. It's like a dance where each person takes a step forward and a step back, until they find the right rhythm. Negotiation is about finding a way to get what you want while still being fair to others. So, whether you're haggling over the price of a used car or trying to resolve a disagreement with a friend, negotiation is all about finding a win-win solution.</p>",
