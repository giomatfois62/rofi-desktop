Environmental devastation?  Labor precarity?  Alienation?  We pick a different societal plague each week and talk with an expert about how that plague makes the coronavirus deadlier. \n</p> \n\n     We then move on to discuss \u201ctreatments\u201d or even \u201ccures\u201d for that plague: what kinds of political or cultural action we can take to \u201ccure\u201d it.  Since many of our guest experts are also artists, they are invited to share a creative work on the topic\u2014a song, poem, monologue\u2014of their own creation or choosing.\n</p>\n\n     Guests include poet and Friends of the Earth organizer Jeff Conant, Dr. Rupa Marya of the Do No Harm Coalition and the band Rupa and the April Fishes, performance artists Annie Sprinkle and Beth Stephens, theatre activist Aryeh Shell, affordable medicine activist Merith Basey, playwright and San Francisco Mime Troupe member Michael Gene Sullivan, and many more.\n</p>\n\n     Your host, L.M.

The process begins with ASIA\u2019s Committees informing the podcast about new and influential scientific papers relevant to the committee\u2019s interests. Then the podcast host(s) then interview the author(s) of the papers, approaching their project from each perspective.

So successful eradication of the infection prevents stomach ulcers from recurring. Bleeding ulcers and esophageal ulceration from acid reflux is rarely seen now with a very potent proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole. On the other hand autoimmune disease of the bowel such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis is on the increase although biologic agents are now able to alter the disease course so that the overall prognosis is better in these patients. Irritable bowel syndrome is more often diagnosed and its treatment leaves much to be desired. Screening colonoscopy has decreased the death rate from colon cancer. We also have a better understanding of anorectal disease and it's management. I am a professor of Medicine and have been practicing for over 30 years and offer my insights into our digestive wellbeing.",

A Hollywood caricature of marijuana, the people who grow, sell, use and enforce against it.\nA Christian conservative who believes in God and marijuana; and experience that goes back before todays CBD and \"legalization\" schemes. Mike has been a grower, seller, smuggler, advocate, political consultant and federal prisoner who has seen the topic from every angle.\nEvery legalization scheme today is full of things that are not true, and there is no one to judge balls and strikes. The merchants and pro marijuana people will not and neither will the forces who wont let prohibition go.\nWhere does that leave you? Confused if you are like most people who have no experience with marijuana or the people who use it.\nYou deserve to know the truth about marijuana and its history if they are going to \"legalize\" in your neck of the woods.\nThe Marijuana Fraud Podcast is your anti fraud source for everything factual about marijuana going back to antiquity.",

        "description": "<p>Carrie Warren FNP, a certified medical weight loss provider with years of real world clinical success in weight loss treatment/management, will provide you with inspirational stories and enlightening facts behind the science of obesity management - all from the prospective of promoting health and wellness in the clinic setting. Carrie will debunk some old myths and set the record straight using evidence based practice and share with you how you can achieve success in promoting your health and wellness. As a provider, there is nothing more satisfying than to have someone give you a great big hug and truly thank you for helping them! You as a patient or provider will want to learn how to achieve success towards better health. Contact: Carrie@RemoteMedicalWellness.com Bio: Carrie Warren\u2019s medical background started with receiving her RN degree and license in 1991. She specialized in pediatrics for 14 years, with the last 5 as a Pediatric ER Nursing Supervisor before moving to Alaska. She then moved on to become the Acute Care Director for a rural critical access hospital where she discovered her passion for teaching and continued learning. In order to support her new found passion, she transitioned into the roll of Education Director for a larger hospital where she provided a variety of continued education to medical staff. Since then, she continues to educate her patients, providers, and community with more of an obesity focussed curriculum. In early 2009, she completed her advanced degree as a Family Practice Nurse Practitioner and began practicing medicine as a provider where she discovered the critical need for a better way to help her patients deal with a multitude of health issues - ultimately exacerbated by their obesity. Recognizing there is actually a nation wide epidemic of obesity she decided to be proactive instead of reactive. To start REALLY making a difference, in 2016 Carrie took it upon herself to create a medical weight loss program in rural Alaska. The first step is for her to stop just treating symptoms and start treating obesity as the disease. Starting with extensive research, adding additional personal education, going to specialty conferences, becoming recognized for her additional education and knowledge base she now has a thriving and very successful medical weight loss program. She has helped hundreds of people achieve weight loss, but more importantly achieve health and wellness. Often being asked out side the office for advice. She realized that to really influence and help others, she needs to continue to speak up to a wider audience. Creating this Podcast does just that, and will demystify some misconceptions that were once thought to be true regarding obesity management. Carrie is going to share her wisdom and clinical experience along with all the tidbits of knowledge she has learned over the years. Her fun personality, compassion, professionalism, and spunkiness has helped so many people do the happy dance out of her office!</p>",

Why is this important ? * The U.S. healthcare system is in crisis.

My name is Craig Lustig and more than 30 years after hearing the words, \u201cyou have cancer,\u201d I\u2019m having conversations about what has changed in the cancer experience, what hasn\u2019t and the work ahead.</p><p>When I meet newly diagnosed cancer patients, I encourage them, that regardless of their prognosis, remember that just because you have cancer, doesn\u2019t mean that you are cancer. You have a family, friends, a community, a profession, hobbies and dreams. The impact of cancer is significant, but just because you have cancer, all of the elements that make you unique are still there.</p><p>This podcast aims to do a few things. First, take a big picture view of the cancer experience. Let\u2019s talk about treatment decisions, side effects and clinical trials. But I also want to focus on questions like, what does it mean to be a young adult, a person of color, a queer person with cancer, an older person, a caregiver. In the US there are more than 18 million cancer survivors and growing. What does it mean to integrate the cancer experience into your life 1, 5, 10, 20 or 30 years after your diagnosis? These topics are complicated, because every person impacted by cancer is a unique and complex individual.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Join Canadian Podcast Host and HG Content Creator, <strong>Tori Moline (@goldenteachertori)</strong>, as she takes a deep dive into an untalked about maternal health crisis <strong>Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG)</strong>. HG is a genetic pregnancy illness characterized by cyclical vomiting, malnutrition, weight loss and dehydration. It's an uphill battle and can often take years to heal from. Many medical professionals do not know about HG. Many mom's are treated poorly in doctor/hospital care while barely surviving and growing a baby. The current solutions being offered to HG mom's are not working and having short/long term consequences. Some brave women have found a glimmer of hope in a highly<strong> stigmatized </strong>(sometimes <strong>illegal!</strong>)<strong> anti-nauseant</strong> <strong>plant</strong> during this time; <strong>cannabis.</strong></p><p>For centuries, HG pregnancies have often gone undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, and/or in some cases, congratulated because of maternal weight loss. History tells us that pregnant women have been silenced for a very long time. History tells us that pregnant women have not been given the space, community, or resources that allow them to thrive. History tells us that HG mom's have been the biggest victim's of this.</p><p>HG mom's have not received proper care for generations. HG mom's who have faced HG pregnancies have <strong>rarely</strong> been given education, resources, or appropriate care. </p><p>Cannabis laws vary state to state and country to country. The barrier to many HG mom's is access. It is inhumane that HG mom's are drug tested at birth and persecuted according to their state laws/hospital policies for trying to survive HG.</p><p>16 raw stories capturing HG and it's multi-layered wrath... 16 women's stories illustrating a maternal health crisis... 16 HG mom's who bravely chose cannabis.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome to <strong>Modern Mom's Wellness Podcast </strong>with Jenna Johnston CNS, MSCN and Renata Filiaci MSHW, CD (DONA). We are here to discuss with you all things motherhood, whether it be fertility, pregnancy, postpartum, or the journey through the process with an abundance of resources, emotional support, guidance, and experts. We are starting this podcast to share simple and practical ways that moms can support their physical and mental health during pregnancy and the years postpartum through the use of nutrition, supplements, herbal medicine, and lifestyle factors like sleep, stress management, movement, etc. so they can feel fully nourished during this transformative time in their lives. By incorporating conventional medicine with alternative medicine, we want to show they can both coexist together, and it doesn't have to be black or white.</p><p>We are catering to the moms who are looking for something that's quick and easy to understand and also offers them practical ways to include these suggestions into their lives (i.e., tips and tricks). One of our goals is to empower mothers to take care of their health because that means they can better care for their families and, in the long run, it will improve their children's health too.</p><p>Disclaimer: This podcast and social media presence represents the opinions of Jenna Johnston and Renata Filiaci and their guests on the show and social media platforms.
