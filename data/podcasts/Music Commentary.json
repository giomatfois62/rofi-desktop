As three young music professionals at the very beginning of our career, we found ourselves continuously discussing various music topics as it related to the world around us. Topics ranging from orchestral repertoire, conducting, music education, etc. would come up in hour long Facetime calls. One day, we decided to share our discussions with the world, and Relative Pitch was born. We feel that the purpose of our podcast is to showcase the talent, leadership, and passion that we see within our field of music, and to help pave the way for much needed change in our community that will make it a more diverse, enriching, and equitable atmosphere for anyone who wants to be a part of it.",

While the discussion and promotion of STEM fields is the main focus of the show, Art plays a key role as well. The Art portion of the show discusses various manners and how it relates to STEM. Full STEAM Ahead promotes careers in the STEAM field and serves as an outlet for professionals looking for inspirational interviews.\n\nThe goal of the podcast is to uplift African Americans and people of color in the fields listed above. While tons of money each year are donated to STEAM fields by companies, celebrities, athletes, influencers, etc., the world only gets to see small clips of these interactions. On one end of the spectrum, there are several radio shows and podcasts that focus on at least one, if not all of the following: pop culture, hip-hop culture, politics, or sports. Completely opposite of this, there are podcasts and radio shows that discuss: academia, heavily technical topics, and STEM. Full STEAM Ahead aims to have a little bit of both.\n\nStarring James aka J Linz, Allante aka LL, Brill, Diggs, Dr. Shar and Taylor D. The show consists of three segments and a main topic or interview. Segments include LITT (Lessons In The Trap), Nature Vs. Nurture and Blowing Off Some STEAM.

Claire was very open and engaging and your questions were balanced and the ones I would have probably asked too.\u201d - profcolinclark\n\n\nThe Vinyl Detroit Podcast features dad and vinyl enthusiast Brian as he takes listeners through some of his favorite records. With many being somewhat obscure and others not so much, Brian digs into the origins of the artist, recording and art direction and design of the record.\n\nThe podcast will also feature long form interviews with some of the artists and labels digging deeper into their creative process, inspirations and influences and more. Brian, who is an interviewer in his professional life and a recovering musician, has the ability to connect with the artist on their level.\n\nSo sit back, relax and let's give it a spin.",

We\u2019re going to be talking about everything we\u2019ve been listening to and watching, but first and foremost we\u2019re going to be talking about concerts.\nTo make the most of the stampede of live music we\u2019re about to witness from arena tours to 19+ shows to basement gigs, we\u2019re going to giving you our best on the road today. We\u2019ll be breaking down setlists, talking about fanbases, and having a larger conversation about the artist or work in question.\nWe\u2019ve also got episodes about movies, TV shows, sports, and of course music, plus everything else our team of pop culture-obsessives want to deliver to you. So like and subscribe if you\u2019re a concert addict and want to be part of a conversation on all of the concerts hitting Toronto.",

They share poignant moments, hilarity and plenty of dad jokes as they wind their way through their middle-age in the music business experience and Bush's life of songs. ",

        "description": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m Yael and welcome to The Brass Ceiling.\n\nI am a trumpet player, but also a musician, and most importantly, a storyteller. I also happen to be a girl, and despite it being 2022, only 3% of trumpet players are female. Consequently, I have always had to navigate a male-dominated environment riddled with gender, age, and power dynamics\u2026 in other words I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of crap and I\u2019m sick of it!\n\nThe title of this podcast, The Brass Ceiling, is really just a play on the phrase \"the glass ceiling\"; this pun on the famous saying feels relevant as I want to bring to light the gendered struggle that female brass players experience which is preventing them from thriving in this niche, just as on a more macro level, women and most non-straight-cis-white-men have to navigate countless systems that were not built with them in mind.\n\nI want to use this space to talk about our stories and our musical journeys, but I also want to use this platform to crowdsource and workshop ideas to make the arts more equitable. The goal is to find that sweet spot that is fun and nostalgic, but also rigorous and forward-facing. I\u2019m hoping that by sharing our experiences, by engaging in dialogue about the systems that need changing, and by delving into music in a way that is accessible as well as palatable,  that we will in fact be shattering the Brass Ceiling, together.",

        "description": "<p>Eurobliss, since 2013, is the ultimate lip-smackin' thirst-quenchin' Eurovision chat show, hosted by Andy Earnshaw, Juan Donoso Casanellas &amp; Mark Dowd, three of Eurovisions craziest, greatest and long standing fans. Do you ever wonder what ever happened to those lost songs of Eurovisions gone by? Each month Eurobliss unearths forgotten classics and will take you for a trip down amnesia lane to remind you of a huge fistful of songs you seriously thought, and in some cases hoped, you would never ever hear again. There is always plenty of drama and lots of controversy, interesting facts and, above all, loads of laughs as your hosts guzzle prosecco and politely disagree with each other. Featuring annual preview and postmortem shows, Desert Island Disc-syle shows and regular in-depth discussions by country....and dont forget Eurovision began in 1956 so there is a catalogue of over 1,800 songs from 51 countries to choose from....the longer it goes on, the happier we are!!</p>",

And during the pandemic, used astrocartography to manifest a move to Houston, TX to chase our dreams and create the life we deserve. \nand now we\u2019re here, ready to share our stories of the wildest year of our lives, how we feel about hot gossip roaming the streets, or just get things off our chests.  this space is meant to be fun, joyful, BLACK, BLACK BLACK and so full of love. \n\nWe\u2019ve felt like very silenced individuals for so long and  think this space is going to be so important for our growth as artists and storytellers but also as people in search of connection and community particularly online\u2014as kids that kind of grew up online but felt very left out and invisible. \n\njoin us every week on FRIDAYS, where there will be a visual episode on YouTube and an audio episode across all streaming platforms. \n\nLock in with us!

We're getting all sappy and nostalgic as we bid adieu to our wild ride together, and what better way to do it than through the epic anthem of Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\".</p><p>Get ready to dive into a whirlwind of emotions as we spill the beans, sharing hilarious stories, tearful goodbyes, and tons of inside jokes. We'll take you on a rollercoaster of memories and melodies that will have you laughing, crying, and probably shaking your head at our sheer madness.</p><p>We're not just talking about the song, folks. Nope, we're going full-on deep dive mode, connecting the dots between our lives and the infectious beats of \"Love Story\". Prepare for our unique takes, personal anecdotes, and the occasional disagreement on the hidden meanings in those catchy lyrics.</p><p>Join us around the virtual campfire as we pour our hearts out, reminiscing about the good, the bad, and the utterly ridiculous moments we've shared. From secret crushes to epic adventures, we'll unravel it all and let you in on the secrets of our unbreakable bond.</p><p>Expect unfiltered banter, spontaneous bursts of laughter, and maybe a few embarrassing revelations along the way. We promise to keep it real, letting our quirks shine through and reminding you that friendships are messy, but oh-so-worth it.</p><p>\"The Final Jam: Our Love Story\" is our love letter to each other and to the journey we've taken as a ragtag group. We're raising a glass to growth, togetherness, and the power of a damn good song. So grab your headphones, tune in, and get ready to join the farewell party of the century!</p><p>Warning: This podcast contains excessive amounts of laughter, friendship overload, and strong emotions. Side effects may include nostalgia, FOMO (fear of missing out), and an overwhelming desire to gather your own crew for a spontaneous road trip.</p>",
