And although this podcast is inspired by my role as a father, I can guarantee that \"Letters To My Son\" will be just as useful for adults who are looking to become the best version of themselves as it will be for children who need to be educated on various life principles.Hope you enjoy!</p>",

These passages are analyzed not as religious dogma but as brilliant pieces of literature and anthropology which bring ancient wisdom back into our lives. \nThe greatest philosophers and writers of the German canon also weigh in on these questions during the Schrift. \nFinally the lectures incorporate Buddhist teachings and the practice of Yoga to bring together East and West, body and mind, eternity and the moment.\nAnd the Schrift will always give you a \"life tip\" to carry with you along the way.\n\nIG: stevehead0001\ns.t.weinberg@gmail.com",

On Zillennial Big Sis I talk about life in your 20's and give big sister advice along the way. It is hard to be a twenty-something in today's world! I'm here to share my life experience with you. I dive into topics about mental health, body image, dating, sex, and relationships. I am the least mysterious person you could meet so no topic is off limits. If you can relate to feeling like being in your twenties punched you in the face... then this is the place for you! \n\nMy guests are friends, family, and experts that will share about their lives and discuss interesting topics.

Here, I and those who appear on this podcast throw all titles, all skin colour, everything away, and focus on the least focused on part of life; Genuine conversation. Like the groups of older generations meeting at your local coffee shop, having a calm debate between two humans of different backgrounds\u2026 different upbringings\u2026 different perspectives. \nNow, for me \u201cMix\u201d, I\u2019m just an idiot, only trying to make it through life, one day better then the last one, one day at a time. I\u2019m a Millennial, not by choice, but because I\u2019m swept into that pile. I come from a cadet background (Royal Canadian Air Cadets), and I DO NOT back down to those who challenge my views/beliefs. BUT, I am just a licensed bodyman from Canada, with possibly some mental disconnections. Honestly, just a nobody that has surprised himself as to how he has gotten this far in his life, when people used to tell him the clich\u00e9 terms like you\u2019re \u201cno good\u201d, \u201cworthless\u201d, \u201cstupid\u201d, \u201cweirdo\u201d; that you\u2019re just stupid and will not succeed. Battling himself, trying to find the \u201cmeaning of life\u201d. If you\u2019re like me, you often find yourself alone, asking. \u201dWhat is the correct way to think/interact? Why are humans here? How did we come to be? What is the REAL TRUTH? Is it Science, Is it Religion? Where are we going? Who will lead us? Who will lead us humans to greatness? But, aren\u2019t we all just that? Human. So why not come along for the ride, be human, come join my discussion circle, have a coffee or tea, and let\u2019s talk; Shall we?\nSome of you, are probably asking, but WHO is this guy? For privacy reasons, I wish for my identity to stay private. I do not wish for fame. YES I DO NOT WISH FOR FAME. I don\u2019t wish to be worldwide know. I just want people to LISTEN TO THE PODCAST. I am merely just using this platform as all AMAZING podcasters do (on this amazing service), Just as a meeting point, to discuss views and have a good discussion, to take a step back from life (stop to smell the roses), just relax, have a conversation about whatever comes to mind and not have to worry about \"Nae-Sayers\". Focus on genuine conversation between two humans. \n",

A podcast and videocast, hosted by Christian Stella (Pharm D, ABAAHP), that discusses different topics within the pharmaceutical, compounding and medical world. \n\nPrecision Opinions Live is recorded inside the offices of Precision Compounding Pharmacy, located in Bellmore New York. \nBeing inside an active pharmacy, we are able to use the podcast and videocast platforms to further assist the pharmacy's customers and partners while being on the front lines of pharmaceutical trends and consumer needs. \n\nChristian Stella and guests provide information and technical insight to both patients and other professionals, as well as offering an avenue for answering any compounding or pharmaceutical questions submitted to the show anonymously. \n\nHaving previously been a guest on shows like; Optimal Health with Dr. Christopher Calapai on WABC 770am, and the LDN Radio show, Christian Stella has taken the next step in providing you the listener with even more opportunities to expand your understanding of medications and pharmaceuticals, by starting Precision Opinions Live.\n\n\"If I can help one patient better understand what they are taking, why something may or may not be providing the results they are looking for or even simply help them use their medication safely and correctly, then Precision Opinions Live has done it's job\" says Christian Stella, Pharm D ABAAHP and host of Precision Opinions Live. \n\n\"Sometimes patients or even other industry professionals are unaware of all of the options that are available to them. By bringing in different guests ranging from doctors with large practices to students, there is a greater chance of connecting that one listener struggling with a medical issue, to the medical professional who can better assist them.\"    \n\nSo join us here at Precision Opinions Live, on our journey to a better understanding of how different pharmaceuticals work and a healthier future.\n  \nThe show can also be viewed on our Youtube channel (all links below) and new updates are always posted on our Instagram, Facebook and Linkedin accounts. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.precisionpharmacy.net\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChoQnIdhY2pUvirfJzowsRQ/featured\nhttps://www.instagram.com/precision_pharm/?hl=en\nhttps://www.facebook.com/precisioncompoundingpharmacy\n\nPrecision Opinions Live is produced and directed by Alexander Ratner of evomximages.com",

The goal is to hopefully help someone, anyone, who desires more out of this life. Wispit is not a medical forum, but more of an encapsulation of  the experiences and words of wisdom of many people, some of whom are colleagues and friends, as a time capsule.   In this journey, I will interview people of various ages, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Although this podcast is designed by a woman, it is not limited simply to women.  It is my hope that anyone, and everyone who tunes in, will be enriched, edified, spiritually touched, and moved to bypass the challenges of life,  and rise from the ashes of this limited existence to a higher elevation of thinking and creativity. Wispit abbreviated stands for Women and Wisdom in Socially Powerful and Interesting Times!  So, Let\u2019s begin this journey together!  After all, we sometimes learn and listen more through the examples of others.\n\n",

        "description": "This program is my personal journey to breaking the life cycle you were born into to the life you choose for yourself. I overcame sexual abuse, growing up extremely poor (raised on welfare) with a single mom of 4 kids in a rural small town. I raised my siblings from 8 years old with an alcoholic parent trying to stay sober. I worked since I was eight years old, was on the verge of a nervous break down at 15. I made the heart breaking decision to preserve my sanity. I ended up moving in with a religious family at 15. This came as a bitter-sweet situation. I finally moved out on my very own and started finally my life, my way, my control. This was the beginning to the life I wanted and deserved. I had a \"normal\" life for while finally. Then I lost some key people in my finally amazing life. My whole world took a brutal turn. This came with even more brutal emotion distress. This was the beginning of my event I can only describe as a nervous break down. I tried so hard to be stronger than my body could take but I had met my limits physically and mentally. This is where I learned the hard reality that I can't take everything life throws me. I learned about what a narcissist was and how I had to set boundaries for my own self preservation. \nI want to share what I have had to learn the hard way so hopefully others will know it can be done. I also would love for people to know to set up boundaries sooner than I did. I always took pride in trying to learn life management by others \u201clife lessons\u201d. I thought I was invincible on the crap life can throw me. \u201c I can take it\u201d is my personal mantra I would tell my inner self, I learned the hard way I do have a limit on what my body can physically and mentally take to my disappointment. I guess I am only human. That sucks !!!! But it is my heartbreaking reality\u2026 that I am NOT invincible. \n\nI came from nothing and had every reason and opportunity to be a pregnant young teen with limited life options. I could have easily repeated the childhood cycle that many fall victim to. Instead, I became a survivor and took my life by the balls and said, \u201cListen bitch I\u2019m speaking\u201d.  In a nice way. Lol. We are our life choices no matter our circumstances. I am now happily married to my high school sweetheart, and we have two wonderful boys. My husband and I have been together for 30 years (and still like each other). Trust me, I want to kill him at times, but I think that is the sign of a healthy relationship. If you don\u2019t want to invoke harm (metaphorically) on your spouse here and there, then you don\u2019t care. Then you are just existing together in a house. This channel and podcast is how not to be a victim. Overcome the shit life throws you and shine like a diamond, inside and out. If you want to know how to do this in a positive, constructive, and sassy yet classy way, tune in. I am happy to share what I have learned. ",

Lo scopo dell'Associazione \u00e8 informare, condividere e valorizzare le battaglie passate, i caduti e tutti coloro che abbiano indossato una divisa. \nQuesto Podcast \u00e8 il primo del suo genere in Italia, i membri dell'Associazione intervistano Veterani che hanno vissuto esperienze traumatiche e hanno deciso di raccontarsi, facendo emergere storie di fratellanza, leadership, coraggio e crescita personale. \n\n_______________________\n\nSeguite i nostri social:\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/nondoletitalia\n\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/APSNONDOLET\n\nLinkedIN - https://www.linkedin.com/company/37538846\n\nSito Ufficiale - https://nondolet.ecwid.com/\n\nFai una donazione: https://www.paypal.com/donate?token=gsQyI8m5s3mrrtuOcl7A7ayOa39Yz5c7BoMKsI2g4RQCoI00IK5nSs7M0A_57vZ-8eHuzrjlnaieJG3Y\n\nVideo e Media : FICIO PRODUCTION\n\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/ficio.production/",

This is a series of digital audio files, made with a wide range of guests who have been generous enough to share their thinking on the topic of consultation in education. Our aim is to provide thought-provoking and engaging content that you can access at times and in places convenient to you, growing out of our shared interest in consultation. Emma teaches a module on the M4 doctoral training in educational psychology that includes consultation, and Jessica, Emily and Zahra are all doctoral students currently on placement in local authority settings making use of consultation in their work. Consultation has any number of different definitions and models. Given our training and background, we are especially interested in consultation as it is used in schools and community settings. We see consultation as a particular type of professional helping relationship, one that holds central the idea that it is the relationship between the consultant and those with whom they work that makes the difference. However, one aim of Conversations about Consultation is to speak with guests who perhaps use different lenses, modalities and approaches and who offer something unique and distinctive that can complement or contrast with our own. It may be a current trainee on a different programme whose research interests include consultation, or an early career practitioner reflecting on consultative working in schools. We speak with experienced practitioners from other disciplines who bring their expertise in working with children young people and their families; as well as psychologists who have been working in the field of consultation research and practice for many years. We hope you will find a conversation to listen to that engages your interest, offers a different perspective or even just provokes a new question or idea that leads to further conversations of your own. You can follow us on twitter to join in the conversation at @TheCACpodcast</p>",

        "description": "The purpose of Full STEAM Ahead is to provide a platform for individuals who are, currently pursuing, or planning to pursue a career in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). While the discussion and promotion of STEM fields is the main focus of the show, Art plays a key role as well. The Art portion of the show discusses various manners and how it relates to STEM. Full STEAM Ahead promotes careers in the STEAM field and serves as an outlet for professionals looking for inspirational interviews.\n\nThe goal of the podcast is to uplift African Americans and people of color in the fields listed above. While tons of money each year are donated to STEAM fields by companies, celebrities, athletes, influencers, etc., the world only gets to see small clips of these interactions. On one end of the spectrum, there are several radio shows and podcasts that focus on at least one, if not all of the following: pop culture, hip-hop culture, politics, or sports. Completely opposite of this, there are podcasts and radio shows that discuss: academia, heavily technical topics, and STEM. Full STEAM Ahead aims to have a little bit of both.\n\nStarring James aka J Linz, Allante aka LL, Brill, Diggs, Dr. Shar and Taylor D. The show consists of three segments and a main topic or interview. Segments include LITT (Lessons In The Trap), Nature Vs. Nurture and Blowing Off Some STEAM. Dive in to see what we\u2019re all about!",

En este podcast veremos las formas en que el miedo se presenta, por qu\u00e9 nos quiere cancelar la creatividad, y cuales son los lugares desde donde las personas sacamos la fuerza para llevar a cabo las cosas que queremos crear.",

So I decided to create this podcast M.M, MENTALITY MATTERS, where I will talk about daily problems, mental health awareness, ways to succeed, coming from the bottom, the different obstacles we all go through, and what is the best way to overcome these problems. Having total control of your emotions in any situation is how you best can protect your peace &amp; your making sure you will always win.

Prior to that, he was one of the top recruiters for the military and went on to become an Army Field Artillery Officer. He has seen tens of thousands of resumes (probably more) and interacted with CEOs and Senior Executives at some of the top companies in the world. And, he is a frequent contributor to <a href=\"http://Entrepreneur.com\">Entrepreneur.com</a>, Fast Company, Forbes, &amp; Newsweek and sits on the council of various organizations.</p><p>Your co-host, Kristina Madden, co-founder and Chief People Officer of Executive Career Upgrades, is a Mindset Expert who has worked with top Executives to develop their mindset, helping them to reframe their state of mind to achieve success and reach their true potential. Kristina has consulted for some of the fastest-growing companies on the Inc. 500 list.</p><p>Resumes almost never clearly describe someone\u2019s own \u201ctrue skills and achievements,\u201d most of the time, hiring managers want to focus on specific bullet points in a job description. This isn\u2019t something that is new; this is a challenge candidates and hiring managers have had going on for years. Also, most people are confused in their career. They don\u2019t know what to target, they don\u2019t know how to build a clear impactful message, and most of the time settle for mediocrity which leads to poor job performance, low pay, and unfulfillment. Not only do Tim and Kristina Madden attract high-quality candidates for companies, but they are also passionate about helping high achievers land that next multiple 6-figure job, which most of the time is less about tactics and more about mindset and confidence.</p>",

        "description": "Naturalies.\n \nMy name is Samantha-Jo, I am the host for this amazing podcast that I am hoping save souls. My reasoning for starting this podcast came about after I gave my life to Christ on July 11, 2021. I started finding myself constantly want to talk about my struggles (HOT: humble, open & transparent), the things that have given me strength, the things God has done for me & most importantly the things I know that God has for me. I know you're thinking \"oh here we go with some religious podcast\" but I'm asking that you look deeper than that. I am a Christian & yes I pray this podcast changes lives in ways beyond my belief but if its not enough to convince you to stay I will also mention the other things I am that God has allowed me to be. I am a single Mother of 4, YES FOUR amazing boys who at the end of this year will be 12, 6, 4 & 2. I am a business owner (if you have instagram JosCraftShack & Sheis.waisted).  I am also a nurse, I have been for almost 4 years now. So again if religion isnt enough to convince you to stay then stick around for the other things I have to offer.\n\nWhy Naturalies?\nI recently (1 year ago) left a very toxic relationship after 8 years & literally started completely over in the middle of the pandemic with all 4 children. I literally built my own kitchen table, tv stand, coffee table, my bed & childrens bed & started over knowing only what I thought I knew. Black women have been placed in boxes all of our lives. \"Starting over is harder than you think so you should probably stay\" \"You cant do it without this person or that person\", \"You have to act this way, its not lady like to do it that way\", \"You cant jump out on faith because nobody in our family has done that\", \"You cant be better than what you come from\", \"your idea isnt good enough to take you there\" ALL LIES, LIES, AND MORE LIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE PLACED ON BLACK WOMEN & LADIES YOU DO NOT HAVE TO AGREE TO MEET ANY STANDARD YOU, YOURSELF, DID NOT SET! This is my safe haven for black women, no matter what you look like, your body size, your bank account or profession, single mom, married mom, in a bad situation, left a bad situation LISTEN I do not care. Come, let your hair down, act the way you want to act even if it doesn't make sense to anyone else, cry a little, heal a lot & know that this is a sisterhood.\n\nIm so ready for this journey. I love you ladies. ",

If you have a deep desire  to enhance your self autonomy and  to finally have a say in co-creating what most people desire; peace on earth, love, a healthy lifestyle and freedom to move, live and express oneself without judgments, this podcast will touch on many topics that will be your guiding light in such dark times.\n\nThe Great Break touches on various topics that surpasses mainstream societal perceptions and belief systems by seeking the interconnective links and synchronicities  in all things verses indifferences and separation consciousness. This includes marrying mysticism, science, religions, ancient medicines, sexuality, tribal rituals, psychology, health and fitness and much more.\n\nIt's time to enhance and expand our collective consciousness by breaking free from mind influencing conditionings of who we once believed to be and to begin finding the commonalities in one another to empower each of us of who we are truly meant to be...

That ~ internal disappointment and fear that you have no clue what you're doing with your life~... I guarantee you we've all been there. Because I know how hard it can be to shake that feeling, I'm here to remind you that everyone's journey looks different. Each week I will be diving into deep conversation with great, unique individuals who share their wild life journeys and the path that's gotten them to where they are today. Exposing the good, the bad, and the ugly; I'm here to remind you that there is no rule book, we are all just doing life :) ",

        "description": "In this podcast series I explore various aspects of holistic healing, as an Intuitive Healer experiencing the world and the healing energies around us.\nWe will touch on, and go in-depth about, many topics - including Meridians, Chakras, Yin Yang energy, self-healing techniques, Flower Essences, Meditations, Guided Imagery, Color Healing, and the effect of the cosmos on individuals and the world via zodiac signs and other cosmic events (moon phases, eclipses, meteor showers and the like). Content is intuitively guided and so what comes up is what I will be talking about!\nOften, if not always, content reflects what is going on in my own personal healing journey, or what I see coming up for those around me, or both.\nHere's a bit about me and my background:\nI was born in America and lived there for just over two decades before I moved to Israel with my family over 20 years ago. \nI am a Holistic Healer with over ten years of experience practicing CranioBalance Therapy, have a thriving range of Flower Essences (Beit Roga Gardens*) made from flowers, trees, and elements in my home community in Israel, as well as from the Dead Sea, and run a private practice called Beit Roga* (House of Tranquility). I have learned many other holistic healing techniques along the way, and all my healing is done on an intuitive level. (*Check out more at beitroga.com and beitroga.com/shop)\nI started out as a Physical Therapist and quickly learned that I was healing via intuitive feedback. I also recognized that simply dealing with the physical aspect of a client's pain or dysfunction was not dealing with the whole picture. \nOver the years I have trusted my inner knowing and followed my intuitive guidance to learning more and more about holistic healing, and most importantly, to trusting the information that comes to me intuitively. It all links back together and each time I learn another aspect of healing I am amazed anew at all the inter-connections. It all comes from one Source, and that is made clear over and over again. \nWe are living in exciting, magical times when more and more healing is coming up to the surface. Old healing practices coming back to modern day use, intuitive guidance on the rise in peoples' awareness, holistic healing becoming more and more popular with the general population, and a greater forum expanding globally for all this information to come to light.\nIf you have found me, then there is magic here for you to explore. I look forward to reading your comments about how this information resonates for you. \nDevorah Harow\nAlchemist and Intuitive Healer\nIsrael\nHealing from the Holy Land\n",

With the surge of COVID-19 and social distancing, I was a broke college student, and I was \"po\" when it came to balancing the areas of my life. By \"po\" I mean, I had all the information in the world, but applying it was a different thing. My mindset needed a lot of work. Over the last 2 years, I've strived to live out a more balanced life, and I want to share my journey with people that know what it's like to stretch a penny as my Mom calls it. This podcast explores the areas of wellness in relation to social issues and personal growth. ",

They wanted a brand that represented people who aspire to be the best version of themselves; in any aspect of their life. They know that self-development is a ever lasting battle and constantly one that is uphill - that is where the term \"HYP\" was established; which stands for Hit Your Peak. As time went on, we knew getting on as many platforms as possible would be the fastest way to help the most people and build our community. That is why this podcast was created; to try to give y'all insight or different perspectives on variety of topics.

        "description": "Hey y'all! My name is DaAujana and welcome to my spoken word diary. Inspiration for this diary was drawn from a multitude of sources, but the main one being high school and my first semester of college. I've always been shy and introverted and isn't a bad thing by any means, but it has caused me to feel an overwhelming amount emotions that have been not so good along the way. The biggest thing I've had to cope with is being alone and not feeling so confident sometimes - and because of that, it has caused me in the past and in the present to withstand what feels to be an uphill battle. Thus, I want to share my stories with all of you because we are going through our own ups and downs. We are all impacted by the actions of our world and instead of remaining shy and silent, I want to use my voice to empower others through sharing my own stories(both serious and ridiculous ones) and truly journey through the process of stepping out of ones embarrassment, shyness, shame, etc and truly being who you are. This journey is also like a mini journal for me to spill out and say all of the things that I have wanted to express for so long, but hadn't because I was too afraid to- I can only hope that through my courage and my words that it will encourage you all to feel empowered to truly be unapologetically yourself and slowly show people the real you and step into your true prime.\u26a1\ufe0f",

So we became Soul Sister in our own twisted way.  First meet Allie who is a fiery blonde with freckles, a successful real estate powerhouse and mother of 2. She started as a teen Mom who attended beauty school as a start her intro into adulthood. Which is where she met a fellow teen Mom Samantha who is now a dark haired gypsy, thriving blogger, emotional support coach and single mother of 2.  Little did we know we would meet each other during a time of growth, hardships and misfortune. Over 15 years later these Twisted Sisters have overcame failed relationships, solo parenting, poverty, starting businesses from scratch, marriage and overcoming debt. To defying near death illness, navigating the business world at a young age, becoming a widow to suicide and learning how to follow our passions/dreams despite certain challenges.  In our battle through life we have made some wonderful connections and relationships with some very prominent people. We are thrilled that we get to share these beautiful souls with all of you and discuss the various impacts in their lives which in turn helped lead them into success and happiness. Follow these Twisted sisters as they believe despite certain hardships, you can't take life too seriously, imperfection is beauty and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. </p>",

        "description": "Hosts Sarrah and Jasmine create a conversational journey as they take on unchartered territories of what is to become a 'New Human' through all topics Mind-Body-Spirit. \n\nThe hosts' life-long, personal, metaphysical and extra-sensory events alongside decades of spiritual practice provide  a  springboard for all-encompassing and unlikely discussions based around the purpose and machinations of existence, through the merging of Science and Spirit as we transform into our personal and collective human evolution through Ascension. \n\nSarrah and Jasmine take turns each week opening the discussion for anything and everything related to becoming a New Human.\n\nBeyond Darwin\u2019s evolve or die hypothesis of survival of the fittest, humanity has done a fantastic job of survival, but with little regard to the expense of the planet, our health, each other, and our soul\u2019s intended journey of spiritual awakening into love and unity consciousness. \n\nThe next evolution of human development can not mimic the past, nor do most of us want it to. As the rest of the world weighs out the long-planned Great Reset, the New Human challenges that the greatest transformation of humanity will take place on the inside first. We explore the paradigms of spiritual practice, dogma, societal mass consciousness and its ongoing programming, and propose new ways to discover our own deepest truths. We learn how to discover a deeper resonance beyond our five senses.\n\nFrom Med-Beds to Frequency Medicine, Extra-Terrestrial civilizations to using the human body as a frequency antennae, spirituality, oneness, ancient wisdom leading to full-energetic awakening, the sky\u2019s the limit as we conceptualize together, the latest discoveries and ideas that will transform the progress of the human race in the way it was always intended - a more natural and connected soul-driven evolution. \n\nWe\u2019ve all heard about the New Earth. Let\u2019s take the journey together to uncover this new human that will thrive as it brings forth its Golden Age, ensuring that the next human evolution is for the betterment of all.\n\n~ Hosts, Jasmine Sterling and Sarrah Powell\n~ Original Music by permission of artist Ray McGeehan   https://amzn.to/3M3MPKg\n\nwww.sarrahpowell.com\nwww.bighappyplanet.com",

When you sync up the mind, heart, and spirit, it unlocks a whole new world. Welcome to the adventure of YOUR lifetime.  It's time to listen... doodle... and shine!\n \nSpoken Art Journaling is designed to be both meditative and mind blowing. Three years ago, Molly caught her husband staring out into space and thought for sure he must be thinking of something earth shattering. Nope! When asked what he was thinking about, he responded with, \u201cNothing.\u201d Astonished at how a person could do such a thing, his comment put her on a journey of quiet time and self-discovery. What she discovered is that thinking about nothing was not her jam. She realized that allowing her mind to express itself through color and the impressions all around her (inside & out), tapped into her heart and spirit too. She coined the technique Spoken Art Journaling and 8 journals later, she\u2019s a happier & healthier person because of it. \n\nMolly Nece is CEO of GOLDEN Age Leadership (.com) and dabbles in the spirituality side of life at MollySHINES.com. She believes every person drives results and deserves to shine. Reach out to Molly for help mining your gold--it doesn't always mean dollars and it doesn't always make sense.\n",

What are the range of emotions and feelings about going back to work? Has your company addressed various situations of home-based, on-site or hybrid? Or put in place a timeline or new policies? What questions should you be asking? Is flexibility a concern, or lack of it? What changes can I make in how I manage that will support the diverse needs of my teams? Are we ready?

People will receive the thoughts, perceptions and expressions of the son, Millennial Z, born at the end of the Millennial generation and the beginning of Generation Z, and the father, born at the end of the Boomer generation and the beginning of Generation X.  Each is thoroughly a hybrid of their respective generation margins and all that entails.  Even though they are alike in many aspects, they quite obviously see the world differently, think from a different time, culture and paradigm, and act from an entirely different framework and relationship with life.  Please join us for twice weekly podcasts on subjects that concern all of us. We talk about what you talk about. Thank you for listening!\n\nEmail:  MillennialZandBoomerX@gmail.com\n",

This podcast is a story of the most amazing adventure ever created, from when the dream first started, till we are able to complete all the 5 wonderful adventures we have planned.

I'd argue one of the best parts of friendship is being able to talk about anything and everything and go really deep into random topics.

We hope that with The Lighthouse Podcast, you as listeners, can find support and guidance with each other.\n\nA lighthouse provides stability and guidance to bring sailors back to the harbor in all weather conditions. Everyone, at one time or another, needs a lighthouse to guide them through their fogs and darkness of life. There\u2019s ups and downs in life, and it\u2019s very easy to get caught up in surviving the rough seas. It\u2019s easy to lose hope and forget to look up for the lighthouse when you\u2019re lost at sea. Since light is the only thing that can penetrate through darkness and point ships in the right direction, we hope that we can be a lighthouse to help the members of the SASE and AAPI community to steer their boats away from the rocks and toward their goals. After listening to The Lighthouse Podcast, we hope that when you, the listener, find another person in need of support, care, or guidance, you can give back and also shine a light to help guide them back home too! \n",

Turns out, I just needed to get in touch with who I truly am and what I desire in this life. Now I am no longer a people pleaser, and am able to live my life more authentically to who I am. \n\nI have created my business through using my intuitive abilities to help others realize who tf they are. I am taking you through the lessons I have learned throughout this journey and the lessons I have yet to learn.\n\nIf you are looking for a podcast that is raw, real, full of love, acceptance, and life lessons, you've found it.

Through reflecting on these conversations and oneself, the goal is for our listeners to develop an environmental self-awareness and sense of belonging in a global context.

You can learn more about that right here: https://linktr.ee/awaresocialmedia\n\nI focus on creating effective branding and messaging for people and communities who are often left out of mainstream marketing. Part of that mission involves having a keen understanding of social awareness...and in my case, that meaning is twofold.\n\nWhy is it so important to properly and effectively represent LGBTQ+ people and all people who might be considered \"other\" in society? Because being represented by someone who looks and IS like you\u2014someone who shares your experiences\u2014makes a difference. It makes you feel seen, heard, and understood for who you are as an individual\u2026not just as a member of a group. When we feel seen, our self-esteem rises; we feel empowered; we have more confidence in ourselves and our abilities. And that confidence translates into success: career advancement, higher paychecks (if you're working), better relationships with friends and family members\u2026even better health outcomes!\n\nLet me be clear, however, that I know I do not speak for everyone. I may be bisexual, but I am still an able-bodied, cisgender, white male. This platform is intended to create a space for people from many diverse communities to come together and share their stories, businesses, and to discuss topics relating to social media and representation.

We discuss everything! Daniel, Hamza, Joseph, Joshua, Laith, Sachin, and Uzayr are your hosts. None of which are flawless. This is immediately apparent since our podcast includes an introspective segment in which we recognise our mistakes. But banter each other along the way. All of this being said, if you want to listen to fun but interesting conversations or have ever wondered what happens in a guys group chat, this is the place to be. And if that's the case, please allow me to extend a warm welcome to Guys Down Bad.\nInstagram: @officialgdbpodcast \nTikTok: @officialgdbpodcast\nEmail: guysdownbad@gmail.com",

See below:\nS22 \u4e2d\u6587 - \u96ea\u58eb\u9054\u5c71\u8207\u6211\nS11 The mountain is calling, i must go.\n\n\nUpdated on April 30, 2022: i was guided to rename the show as \"Journeys to Mt Shasta\".\n\n\nMt Shasta is a magical place that i call \u201cHOME\u201d especially in the spiritual way. Ever since my first visit Mt Shasta back in October 2011, my entire life has been shifting and transforming to the levels that i could never ever imagine how my life has becoming now and continuing to evolve to be better and greater.\n\nStarting podcasting \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d is one of my latest assignments from Mt Shasta, so the Mother Earth Heart energy could reach out to the world further and influence more people\u2019s lives to shifting our consciousness as a whole.\n\nIf you know about Mt Shasta, you probably heard of Lemuria, Telos, High Priest Adama, Master Saint Germain and so many more\u2026 And yet, \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d is going to be based on my personal experience with Mt Shasta. To share my real life transformation examples will be the main attribute of this show. In addition to just my own storytelling, there will be soul families and friends to share their profound enlightenment experience with Mt Shasta. \n\ni am so excited about this new way of storytelling, instead of trying to publish \u201cMt Shasta and i\u201d book 1, 2,3, which i started a few years back and somehow i did not go too far and just suddenly stopped.  Now i believe it\u2019s time. Thank you, Mt Shasta and the Spirits. i am in gratitude!\n\ni am also starting a Chinese / Mandarin version of \"Mt Shasta and i\" show. They will not be the exact same duplicates with only language difference. They will have their own uniqueness individually. \n\ni understand having two shows at the same time is a huge task, but i have always feel that i want to do both since the beginning. Now, i just need to start the first step and slowly build up the momentum. Constantly reminding myself not to push myself too hard. Learn to pace myself and remember to breathe.\n\ni am a going-with-the-flow kind of guy, so it is not going to be in chronological order about my story. i will just follow the guidance from Mt Shasta and the Spirit!",

In a series of monthly interviews I shall interview academics from across different career stages and disciplines to learn how they have coped with their own experiences with Impostor Syndrome.

I started this podcast to connect, learn, grow, and interact with every day, amazing people like me and you. Here, I will share tips and practical tools to help others with many of the life issues we all face daily. \n\nOn this platform, not only will you hear from me, but I will invite many of my friends and colleagues to share their practical and professional advice with us all. Here, at Call Me Camille, we will grow and learn together on a comfortable, non-judgmental, interactive, fun, and safe platform. I invite you to take this journey with me because Call Me Camille was created for you, me, and the countless others who seek a truth-based community in this ever-changing, sometimes untruthful world. On this podcast,  we will talk about love and relationships. We will have discussions about mental, physical, and spiritual health issues. We will talk about fitness. We will share parenting tips and have conversations about family and motherhood. I'm no beauty expert, but I will bring experts on this platform who will give us suggestions, and tricks on beauty, skincare, and more to help us keep looking our best. Here, we will discuss mid-life everything, so buckle up, friends! \n\nDo you love to bake or cook? I don't love cooking or baking, but I can cook and bake. My family loves my cooking, and I honestly love eating, so let's share recipes. Plus, what a great excuse to get great cooks and chefs here on the pod who can help us spice things up in the kitchen. If you're at all curious about how we will cook together, then stay tuned, my friends, because we are going to cook up some fun here on the Call me Camille Podcast!  \n\nFinally, I will share everyday truths and encouragement with you from God's Word as a therapist and friend. You called, I answered, and I heard your questions and concerns. I hear you, and I will talk about all of it right here on the pod because I'm listening to you. So take this journey with me as we navigate this thing called life together here, on the Call Me Camille Podcast.\n",

It aims to be provocative to the extent of exploring liberal notions which I have at times felt unease addressing myself; vulnerability and healing, navigating young adulthood whilst living cross-culturally, social justice issues I may have been ignorant to, everything else and more. This podcast documents how I have defined womanhood through the persons, experiences and influences in my life; bringing light to the universal experiences of many others in this lifetime.

We will dive into random topics and stories to explain some of the intricate processes we have in our society, or just to talk about random things that we think are interesting. Kory will objectively research and present, mostly in rant form coupled with humor, the information he has learned during the research process. Topics will vary tremendously as we scour the internet's information and put to use the fact that we have the ability to learn almost anything if we take the time to look it up. Mostly, we are just going to hang out and bullshit around while hopefully obtaining some form of interesting though probably useless knowledge or we will just have some fun...either way. ",

        "description": "<p>This podcast started off as Inside Your Head, where I spent time discussing various topics related to mental health with other professionals in the field. It has since, changed a bit in shape and form, into a podcast aiming to create a platform where I can share people's stories, with the hope to help them and at the same time create a space where people can gain some insights into their own current life stressors and how the process of therapy can help in that regard. I also want to share my experience of being a psychotherapist and just share information about therapy and the therapy process.

Through time we grow, we fall in love, we get to hate and forgive. Time is the healer of all good and bad, time is the healer and the killer, and it is our responsibility to take action and do something with this time, all that we experience is a direct consequence of how we utilize the time that is given to us, and so, The Time Podcast was born. \n\nThe Time Podcast was created in an attempt to offer motivation, direction and a getaway from the standards that society sets. My desire is to grow together with my audience and go through the \"challenges\" and \"failures\" of life with a smile on our faces. \n\nThat being said, if you are ready to change your life and take advantage of all of the doors that time opens and closes, to realize that you are a beautiful creation of time and you have been given this gift of life, tune in to The Time Podcast!\n\nFollow Andrei on Instagram @vovcenco https://www.instagram.com/vovcenco/",

To cultivate an awareness, practice, and understanding on how to flourish in this current environment, Source Wellness has created The Intersection Podcast.\n\nThis podcast series explores DEIMW - Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Mindfulness, and Wellness. Each of these components, which often are taught separately, strengthen each other and provide more value when taught together.\n\nSource Wellness interviews subject matter experts whose work connects to DEIMW so that we can collectively uncover the ways that we can heal, grow, and thrive on a personal and systematic level.\n\nThe Intersection Podcast supports us in our lives and at work. Three core principles outline the importance of The Intersection:\n\n1) DEI without Mindfulness & Wellness does not give practitioners the tools & skills to confront implicit bias or combat burnout.\n2) Mindfulness without DEI and Wellness can be used to make people more efficient at the expense of wellbeing and inclusivity.\n3) Wellness without Mindfulness and DEI neglects a crucial component of mind-training and can be very white-centric.\n\nTo sign up for our live webinars, go to our LinkedIn page: https://www.linkedin.com/company/source-wellness/+",

This podcast was birthed from a really special place, in a moment of complete surrender and transformation. It comes from a place of pure love for all that is in this wild world we live in. \n\nThe title for me represents a change in thinking, a change in being. Until not long ago I spent my life carrying around this feeling of never fitting in, self isolating, keeping my vulnerable side silent and afraid of completely owning who I am, rejecting myself before someone else could reject me. Mind you I didn't realise I was doing any of this in the moment. Self reflection and awareness what a beautiful thing! \n\nFor so long I craved that feeling of being accepted, of fitting in but what I didn't realise was that it was me who needed to accept myself all along. My intention for this podcast is to help people find their sense of peace, love, sexuality, pleasure and purpose as well as wholeness and appreciation for all that is.\n\nEveryone is welcome here. You are welcomed, love and accepted here. \n\nThis podcast is going to be fun, random, chaotic and full of #livelaughlove energy because thats who I am. \n\nConnect with me on my instagram @whowantstofitinanyway\n\nCant wait to connect.\n\nLater lovers,\nBec x\n\n",

You only hear about debt when you are personally struggling financially.  \n\nThere are also regulatory changes or changes in the types of debts the sector deals with in recent times compared to just consumer credit debts. A debtor who seeks advice may also have other issues to resolve: domestic abuse, gambling, and benefit problems to just name a few.\n\nThe series of Debt Talk podcasts are here to explore the views of a diverse range of communities  - from debt collections, enforcement agents, and alternative lenders to debt advice charities-  and understand the support need of debtors in such a challenging time.\n\nRipon Ray has been working in the debt advice sector for over 12 years.

The Tafsir of Juz Amma.\n\nImagine how it would feel to have a deep understanding of the surahs contained in the last part of the Qur'an - the surahs that are often recited in our prayers, the surahs that are short in length but very weighty in meaning, carrying the core essential message of the Qur'an. It is a rare opportunity to study these surah's with an extraordinary scholar and thinker who is an expert in both tafsir and hadith.\n\nCambridge Islamic College is a registered educational charity.(Charity Number 1163646) Please support CIC to carry on its mission.

Live a bigger & more full life on your own terms. \n\nI show you how you can feel more safe & grounded in your body and better regulate your emotions & nervous system. \n\nI encourage you to start truly honoring yourself, find your inner and outer voice, create better boundaries, stop people-pleasing and perfectionistic tendencies, and step boldly into a more confident version of yourself.\n\n Upgrade your health, business, & relationships by getting into the driver seat of your own life.\n\nThis is your go-to podcast for discovery. I invite practitioners, makers, healers, artists, musicians, & scientists on the show to share with you their wisdom and medicine. We'll explore a variety of topics that include the intersection of science & spirit, neurology & psychology, medicine & nature, and art & music.\n\nA variety of topics will include; making more money, starting a business you\u2019ve always dreamed of, changing careers, sacred geometry, meditation, breathwork for healing trauma, anxiety & depression-where it comes from and how to change it, creating more value in your business, getting a promotion, losing physical/mental/emotional weight, improving your confidence, leaving or manifesting a new relationship, improving the relationship with yourself and with others, seeking permission, healing from chronic illness, manifestation, & money stories. It\u2019s all served with a side of humor and sass. Plus, you'll learn simple tools for transformation, healing & dealing w/trauma, and creating any change you want in your life. \n\nYou\u2019ll learn to recognize the old patterns/habits that don\u2019t serve you, heal from your past, and create a new story that helps you step more powerfully into a more aligned version of the future you envision.\n\nMy hope is that you get a lot of value from this show so you can create lasting change in your life right now. I hope that you will be curious about the possibilities for your own life you maybe haven\u2019t even considered yet, be inspired by other people\u2019s stories, and learn crucial information that you can apply to your life.",

Your mind impressions determine the conditions of your world. The mind is not selective; it is impersonal and no respecter of persons. The mind is not concerned with the truth or falsity of your feeling. It always accepts as true that which you feel to be true. Feeling is the assent of the mind to the truth of that which is declared to be true. Because of this quality of the subconscious there is nothing impossible to man. Whatever the mind of man can conceive and feel as true, the mind can and must objectify. Your feelings create the pattern from which your world is fashioned, and a change of feeling is a change of pattern.\u201d",

        "description": "<p>Wellish is breaking down the assumption that we aren't good enough until we've reached perfection. Will I ever reach my whole, fulfilled, healed, higher self? Journalist, Sarah Ritondale, is bulldozing a new highest standard when it comes to creating the ideal version of yourself, so you no longer have to feel yourself drowning in self improvement wondering when it will be your turn to reach complete wellness. Whole doesn't mean perfect. She breaks down our fear based thought patterns to create a space for real, relevant, transparent, and vulnerable ideas to genuinely live a life you feel confident in, through exploiting her own life experiences and getting her seemingly well guests to open up about their own well and toxic habits. Sarah validates leaning into the toxic thoughts and behaviors that, truthfully, we all have, and using them to our advantage instead of shoving them down and deciding there's something wrong with us. She inspires empathy towards ourselves by encouraging realistic and tangible philosophies, even if it's not the therapist-recommended way to navigate your life.</p>",

The pathless path is the inner path of Shakti-the embodiment of Consciousness as the Goddess within and without. She is the cause of all dynamic and kinetic energy of the entire Cosmos. She creates, sustains and destroys at will when the time is ready. She is accessible to all of us at any time, with unconditional love and no qualifications needed except with a sincere approach, and commitment to receive her love, beauty and power in the many ways she expresses in reality. Join me on this journey as we cover many topics as numerous as her myriad of expressions in nature and in the cosmos. This journey will enable personal transformation should you choose it. It is your warrior's path if you should decide to wield the sword to cut through delusions, illusions and concepts of what life is about. It empowers you to choose authenticity and being centered instead of being flighty and ungrounded. It gives you the sweetness of life and all of its experiences should you choose to step into authenticity. I look forward to our coming together. \nPeace & Blessings ~ Gayathri Shylesh",

Think of me as your Personal (Cyma)Tree, keeping your Soul Stable as we branch out into Hermetic Horizons & expand our minds into New Spiritual Spaces. \n\nI believe that your Conscious Mind exists because your Spirit is an Infinite Individual choosing to connect with other Individuals, which is why your entire life is about \"Building Relationships\" with spaces outside of your own. Functional Families allow us to Freely Function, and The First Functional Family every one has is their own Physical Body. \n\nProper Spiritual Health leads to Proper Mental Health, and Proper Mental Health leads to Proper Physical Health.\n\nIf you want to learn the truth about how the Masonic Banking System has weaponized Metatron's Mental Mathematics and Mercury's Metaphysical Wisdom to Manifest Humanity's \"New World\" Destiny, then Free Your Mind, Body, and Soul by Joining Our Online Academy at ChaseYourGenes.com",

        "title": "Refer the Reefer with Host Lil Pharmer",
        "description": "<p>Refer the Reefer with host Michael Alkire aka Lil Pharmer is a podcast that references medical cannabis consumption practices, methods and habits of medical cannabis consumers, long time cannabis activists and medical cannabis researchers who are pioneers in their studies. There is not much reliable information, for people to search for when looking for answers on how to consume medical cannabis responsibly for different ailments. Here we hope to shed light on proper ways to prep and consume medical cannabis for these different ailments that it is said to help relieve. Nowadays there are 100s of products and ways to consume them. Even to an experienced consumer there are always new things to be learned about the ever-changing world of legal cannabis. It is becoming ever increasingly popular in many parts of the world and being legalized for usage. More and more people are wanting to try cannabis for the first time, whether it be for recreational purposes or medical relief of any type. More and more people suffering from chronic illnesses that find little to no relief from pharmaceutical prescriptions and want to explore new options. After working in a recreational dispensary in Breckenridge, Colorado for 3 years, talking to clients from all over the world about why they consume and how it helps them, it has become clear that there are benefits to their consumption. Everyone has a unique Endocannabinoid System (ECS) and cannabis effects everyone a little bit differently depending on their own personal chemistry. What is the ECS and what does it control or do? The ECS is complicated, and experts haven\u2019t yet determined exactly how it works or all of its potential functions are listed below. \u2022 appetite and digestion \u2022 metabolism \u2022 chronic pain \u2022 inflammation and other immune system responses \u2022 mood \u2022 learning and memory \u2022 motor control \u2022 sleep \u2022 cardiovascular system function \u2022 muscle formation \u2022 bone remodeling and growth \u2022 liver function \u2022 reproductive system function \u2022 stress \u2022 skin and nerve function These functions all contribute to homeostasis, which refers to stability of your internal environment. For example, if an outside force, such as pain from an injury or a fever, throws off your body\u2019s homeostasis, your ECS kicks in to help your body return to its ideal operation. Today, experts believe that maintaining homeostasis if the primary role of the ECS. We will also be talking about the benefits of legalization, debunk the stigmas of Refer Madness and normalize cannabis consumption for everyone Worldwide. That being said cannabis isn\u2019t for everyone and sometime can cause unwanted side-effects. This could be due to many factors including improper growing, contaminants and/or over consuming one's personal limits. Some people need to eat higher concentrates of edible cannabis and get the same effect as the next person. Sometimes 2.5 mg of THC is enough for one person and then 200 mg for the next to get the same desired effects. We will talk about how to avoid these bad situations and how to deal with them if they occur. We will also reference situations that occurred while trying to retrieve black market cannabis in the past and explain why it is better that it is legal. There are also thousands of different chemovars and cultivars of cannabis out there currently and thousands to come in the near future. These are many new terms that are being used in the industry now and some terms like Indica and Sativa that are not being used as much. Chemovars are used to describe cannabis strains by the chemical contents of the strain with terpene profiles and cannabinoid percentages present in each batch. Cultivars are used to describe a batch with a name of a strain, with the name of the grower and type of cultivation method used to grow it.</p>",

Tiffany AKA Ms. Lilysflow, as she refers to herself, blends her love and passion for skincare education as well as uplifting, inspiring and motivating others to be the highest version of themselves by helping to inspire everyone to walk in their true life's purpose. With guest co-hosts at times, Tiffany loves to spotlight others within the community to showcase their contributions to all her listeners. Her audience reaches all races, genders and ages as she makes it a point to unite all with her broad range of topics.",

Statistics say that 1 woman out of 5 has experience some type of sexual assault and 1 out of 3 between the ages of 11 & 17. Statistics also show that 1 out of 4 men experience some type of sexual abuse in their lifetime and the same ratio as women for young men between the ages of 11 & 17. We all can find statistics in various places, and these can also be different; but you know what? We are not a number, we are human beings who know that we are part of these groups of people who are the making of the stats. We are humans, we are men and women who want to belong to something else other than statistics. We are individuals who need to not feel lonely, alone, ashamed, fearful, abandoned and forgotten. This podcast is for you, for my fellow humans who feel the deepest feelings that sexual abuse has brought to our lives. You are not alone and although I can't promise that you will feel better after listening to this podcast, I feel enormous hope that you will find in these stories some comfort in knowing that you are never alone and that better times are to come.\nemail: powerinsurviving@gmail.com ",

Well, this is my way to give back and pay it forward! Growing up a lot of us were taught to work hard for money but were never educated on how money really works. We work hard on building to leave something for our children but without teaching good habits, right information knowledge, and basic understanding of money, then the generations to come will be in the same predicament if not worst. So tune in weekly as I talk with you about tips and strategies on everything I have come to know and learn about the rules of money, how it has help not only me change my life and how I look at finances but everyone around me as well!</p>",

And those injuries can last a lifetime.\nSome of us have experienced more than potentially our fair share, while some have been able to move within the world unscathed. \nJoin me on my journey to unpack, process, and ultimately free oneself from decades of childhood trauma, early adult trauma, and now middle age trauma that I have experienced. \nI am pretty sure many of you out there can relate and may have even experienced similar events in your own lives that have required one to dig deep, soul-search, and go to uncomfortable places. And I know we can come out the other side much more prepared to face our current challenges while finding some variation of peace that allows us to continuously and positively move forward.\n\nI also offer sage advice that may be of benefit to many...\n\nJoin me for a few minutes, and I am sure you will stay for the entire segment.\n\nThank you, and you are welcome.\n ",

Here you will get the unfiltered truth about the mistakes you continue to make and how to solve them. No more endless searching in the wilderness for love. I've seen the ugly sides of dating and love and I've been lucky to enjoy some joyous moments as well. Over time I have realized a pattern that leads to failure and I learned these lessons the hard way. I am eager to share the knowledge gained over the years from my own experience and that of others who have also walked the path of pain and misery. You don't have to walk through the fire and get burned like I have and if you have a few scars of your own, let's work together to bring you to the other side unscathed. Its time to level up your dating game and get what you truly want in a love relationship. Say goodbye to suckers and settling for less because of the fear of being alone. You deserve the best and you can achieve it. Forgive my brashness but the truth will sometimes hurt. I will help you become the woman who gets what she wants from a man and more. Time to be a true boss lady in all areas of your life.\n\nFor free resources and community to help boss ladies win at love visit: https://bit.ly/helpingbossladieswinatlove",

        "description": "<p>Carrie Warren FNP, a certified medical weight loss provider with years of real world clinical success in weight loss treatment/management, will provide you with inspirational stories and enlightening facts behind the science of obesity management - all from the prospective of promoting health and wellness in the clinic setting. Carrie will debunk some old myths and set the record straight using evidence based practice and share with you how you can achieve success in promoting your health and wellness. As a provider, there is nothing more satisfying than to have someone give you a great big hug and truly thank you for helping them! You as a patient or provider will want to learn how to achieve success towards better health. Contact: Carrie@RemoteMedicalWellness.com Bio: Carrie Warren\u2019s medical background started with receiving her RN degree and license in 1991. She specialized in pediatrics for 14 years, with the last 5 as a Pediatric ER Nursing Supervisor before moving to Alaska. She then moved on to become the Acute Care Director for a rural critical access hospital where she discovered her passion for teaching and continued learning. In order to support her new found passion, she transitioned into the roll of Education Director for a larger hospital where she provided a variety of continued education to medical staff. Since then, she continues to educate her patients, providers, and community with more of an obesity focussed curriculum. In early 2009, she completed her advanced degree as a Family Practice Nurse Practitioner and began practicing medicine as a provider where she discovered the critical need for a better way to help her patients deal with a multitude of health issues - ultimately exacerbated by their obesity. Recognizing there is actually a nation wide epidemic of obesity she decided to be proactive instead of reactive. To start REALLY making a difference, in 2016 Carrie took it upon herself to create a medical weight loss program in rural Alaska. The first step is for her to stop just treating symptoms and start treating obesity as the disease. Starting with extensive research, adding additional personal education, going to specialty conferences, becoming recognized for her additional education and knowledge base she now has a thriving and very successful medical weight loss program. She has helped hundreds of people achieve weight loss, but more importantly achieve health and wellness. Often being asked out side the office for advice. She realized that to really influence and help others, she needs to continue to speak up to a wider audience. Creating this Podcast does just that, and will demystify some misconceptions that were once thought to be true regarding obesity management. Carrie is going to share her wisdom and clinical experience along with all the tidbits of knowledge she has learned over the years. Her fun personality, compassion, professionalism, and spunkiness has helped so many people do the happy dance out of her office!</p>",

But don't worry. He's got it all under control. Most days.\n\nAfter writing his self-help book, Life After Low Self-Esteem, Dimitrius wanted to create a space where people could discuss topics such as mental health, relationships, and other subjects that can be difficult to talk about.\n\nDimitrius came up with the concept of the show while pondering the idea of what happens after you speak up for yourself. Through speaking, Dimitrius wanted to not only speak up for others like himself but provide a safe space for individuals to recount their own personal journeys. You never know when you just need to hear something from someone just like you. In fact, it can make all the difference.",

        "description": "El cambio psicol\u00f3gico no es algo f\u00e1cil de conseguir. Modificar nuestras tendencias, nuestros h\u00e1bitos de pensamientos, sistemas de creencias, conceptos aprendidos sobre nosotros mismos y los dem\u00e1s, etc. requiere mucho trabajo. M\u00e1s a\u00fan, cuando a trav\u00e9s de muchos de estos procesos y aprendizajes, hemos logrado algunos objetivos o nos hemos protegido. Dejar lo que creemos que es seguro a pesar de que nos genere gran dolor o ansiedad no resulta sencillo.\nC\u00f3mo terapeuta, me gustar\u00eda tener las claves milagrosas para dotar a todos de un cambio r\u00e1pido, pero la realidad no es esa. No existen f\u00e1rmacos, terapias, aparatos o energ\u00edas paranormales capaces de producir el cambio psicol\u00f3gico y emocional en una persona de manera inminente. \nLa resiliencia, como hoy d\u00eda leemos, no es algo fortuito, ni m\u00e1gico. La resiliencia es un proceso a trav\u00e9s del cual, una persona va aceptando, asimilando, comprendiendo y elaborando aquellas experiencias qu\u00e9 por su intensidad o frecuencia, pudieron llegar a ser traum\u00e1ticas, hasta el punto, que finalmente consigue flexibilizar e integrar lo que ocurri\u00f3 a su vida, permiti\u00e9ndole adaptarse a su nueva situaci\u00f3n y circunstancia. La persona resiliente no olvida, no pretende dejar a un lado las cosas que vivi\u00f3 por muy duras que fuesen, no responsabiliza a los dem\u00e1s, las circunstancias o la luna, de sus fracasos. El RESILIENTE, es aquella persona que toma lo que ocurre como una experiencia m\u00e1s de su vida, se permite sentir y atiende a su emoci\u00f3n de manera consciente hasta llegar a comprender los hechos y as\u00ed mismo.  Trata el proceso como un aprendizaje donde cada decisi\u00f3n le va llevando a nuevas respuestas que finalmente desencadenan en nuevas opciones que le permiten ir adaptando lo que el fue a lo que \u00e9l es, seg\u00fan el momento que le est\u00e1 tocando vivir. La persona resiliente, con cada experiencia, va alcanzando madurez, sabidur\u00eda, consiguiendo obtener una mirada del mundo, su entorno y su persona m\u00e1s universal y capaz. Se vuelve m\u00e1s eficiente con la edad y los a\u00f1os.  \nLa persona que se sobrepone a una violaci\u00f3n, a un accidente de tr\u00e1fico grave, un c\u00e1ncer, una ruptura, la perdida de un empleo, no lo hace de inmediato, como creemos, no puede no sentir el dolor de la perdida, la rabia, el p\u00e1nico ante lo que viene despu\u00e9s del hecho. Es falso que puede evitar pensamientos negativos e intrusivos, es m\u00e1s, se har\u00e1n reiterativos, persistentes y hasta obsesivos. El que se sobrepone, es el que decide mirar a la vida en su plenitud, aceptando la contrariedad, comprendiendo como la emoci\u00f3n humana es de gran ayuda para su adaptaci\u00f3n, el que se permite elaborar los hechos con paciencia hasta encontrar la calma suficiente para tomar decisiones que le permitan adaptarse y abrir el principio del camino de su recuperaci\u00f3n. Sobreponerse o cambiar psicol\u00f3gicamente, es un esfuerzo consciente desde la humildad, el conocimiento, la experiencia constante, el desarrollo de un trabajo sostenido y creativo en el tiempo y, sobre todo, teniendo como principio el AMOR A UNO MISMO.  PRACTICA LA VIDA DESDE EL AMOR A TI MISMO.\n",

        "description": "Only you know what it is. You\u2019ve worked really hard to hide it, even those closest to you, your partner, your best friend, your parents, have no idea about it. You don\u2019t talk about it, you don\u2019t share it for the fear that if people knew, It would be the end, the end of your job, your relationships, it would be the end of everything you\u2019ve been building. So you wake up, smile, and go about your day and it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019ve got broad shoulders because you\u2019re carrying the weight of your hidden truth all day long. Unnecessarily. \n\nThis is how we, Topher and Jamie, felt for years of our lives, our secrets were different, our coping mechanisms were different, our stories were different, but the SHAME was the exact same. When we finally couldn\u2019t take it any more and asked for help, shared our secrets, the end of days we were sure were coming never came, in its place was a warm embrace, encouragement, praise, the truth no longer weighed us down, we were free.\n\nTeaTox was forged in the fire of the silent rage, fear and shame that weighed us down and then was extinguished by the love and peace we received when we started sharing. Come listen to us share our story, and hear how other people dealt with their insecurities, addiction and everything in between. The power is in the permission to be vulnerable. You cannot fight what you cannot see, so listen, open up, and let\u2019s get to work.",

That is what the history of humanity has shown, and that's what it will always be. We plan to push this movement through entertainment, interviews with influencers, and reflecting on trending topics to explore the true good that lies within all of us. How we doin' is a New York slang, especially in the streets of Brooklyn. It's common to say to those that you see on a day-to-day. But it is also the basis of care, compassion, and love.

Initially you say anything you think is cool and everybody gives a resounding awww! \n\nBut then you grow up a little and things get serious. You start to- or TRY to hone in on the profession you desire and the person you want to be, but you really don't know what you want until you start pursuing it. \n\nYou get into college, trade school, wherever you need to go, and might encounter- it fucking SUCKS pursuing this aspiration. And adulting is HARD. Maybe that aspiration wasn't even yours. We are products of our environment and everybody draws from inspiration. Maybe you looked at dad or mom and said I'm gonna grow up to be just. Like. Them.\n\nThen you figure out, it's not that easy. Not easy becoming them or whatever you want to be. Cause as soon as you graduate you're applying to 200 plus places a month and only 5 declined. In short, This Life Shit Crazy\n\nBut don't worry, I'm trying to find my way just like you.

This is how we enter the Tao, and it's not just a way to garner miracles, but to live in the flow in an open dialog with the substrate of our birth. We can't force miracles to happen, but we maximize their playing field and remain open. They will arrive!</p><p>Host Sarrah Powell has humbly claimed more miracles than the average person, and began to notice similarities in the circumstances of many of her miracles. 5 kinds of miracles would show up repeatedly. The guiding and steering miracles finally revealed how to work with our miracle nature and a floodgate opened for daily synchronicities, abundance, healing, and perfect manifestations..</p><p>Combining a 30 year spiritual practice with the same amount of time on a miracle journey, while putting most of her miracles through the scientific process, Sarrah shares how everyone can align to their miracle nature.</p><p>The results have been astounding - our miracles tangibly demonstrate that Universe, God, Divine Spirit- whatever your believe - is powerful, precise, timely and always working in our favor, as it steers us to our highest good and just possibly, our soul purpose..

My life path has taken many turns, but my innate spiritual being led to develop my natural psychic talents. Consequently,<strong> </strong>I have worked as a Psychic Medium professionally for over 20 years, performing on Live TV and in a variety of events. However, I was always more interested in helping people overcome their problems and grow, so I decided to qualify as a Counsellor Hypnotherapist and have been bringing these skills into my work for over 10 years. Eventually, I wanted to make more of an impact, so I became a Qualified Teacher and upgraded my knowledge with a Masters in Psychology. However, Teaching became more about satisfying the Curriculum's agenda than helping children grow.</p><p><strong>My mission: </strong>Over the last few years I have decided to reach a larger audience and branched out online. I have developed a Soul Growth Coaching business that specialises in helping people live authentic spiritually fulfilling lives, full of growth and synchronistic adventure, and that is my intention with this podcast.</p>",

And understand that doing that thing you\u2019ve wanted to do isn\u2019t more than making a decision and being courageous. I think there\u2019s a gap in the way these stories are being told today. There are many stories about what someone is doing and why they\u2019re doing it but rarely focus on the how.</p><p>That\u2019s when my podcast name came to me. \"Bold Moves: How Did You Know?\"</p><p></p><p>How did you know you wanted to start a business? Advocate for change? Pursue your dream? Beneath it all is the answer to the question: How did you know you could do it?</p><p></p><p>I'll underscore the traits and behaviors it took for these leaders to go from their idea to actually doing it. And together, we\u2019ll see if my hypothesis is right.

I go on the Wisdom app for Android devices and life coach on there and see if I get a joke or a reason when trying to be pragmatic with people. Sometimes the jokes are funny and I'll gon with it, but my job as a life coach is to coach people through where they're at in the life and make transformations happen! I host a panel online for live chat and I transfer it off the app to here without edits! So, please don't be apprehensive, as the topics are purely educational and informational, not perturbing. There are a plethora of suggestions that I have, but please note that advice given on this show is merely a suggestion and you don't have to listen to us or believe a word we say. Take everything with a grain of salt if you must, but you're responsible for your own actions/reactions gained as a result of the show. Thank you and have a wonderful day, and I hope to gain some life coaching clients! To inquire about gaining a life coach or for other business related inquiries, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:Jacob.givler95@gmail.com\">Jacob.givler95@gmail.com</a>.

Then, what if we could magically free these inner parts from their darkness and transform them back into wise powers and guides?</p><p>These transformations and more you will hear on DARK LIGHT TRUTH, hosted by Emily Eldredge, the creator of the Drawing Out Process\u00ae and the ChangeLight System\u2122.</p><p><strong>In this podcast, you will hear <em>real</em> people go through <em>actual</em> sessions of The Drawing Out Process\u00ae - Emily's 7-step emotional healing technique in which a person \u201cdraws out\u201d, talks with, and fully heals an inner part (or parts) at the core of their struggle. In other words, we dive into their darkness, reclaim their light, and reveal their Truth.</strong></p><p>Every session contains a fascinating new mystery to unravel, compelling us to investigate:</p><ol><li><p><em>What</em> or <em>who</em> inside the person is causing the struggle?</p></li><li><p><em>Why</em> is it there? What experiences or events made it feel so unsafe that it got distorted by fear and fell into darkness in the first place?</p></li><li><p><em>How</em> is it trying to protect the person \u2013 or itself \u2013 whatever ways it knows?</p></li></ol><p>Once we hear <em>its</em> stories and <em>its</em> truths, we then rescue it from the darkness. That is, we heal it by freeing it of its fear and reactivity so that it no longer hurts the person. We then re-align it with the person\u2019s desires and Truth so that, together, they can move forward feeling more whole, clear, radiant, and at peace.</p><p><strong>Every session is filled with surprising epiphanies, twists, and turns. We never know <em>what</em> will we encounter - nor <em>who</em>.</strong></p><p>Will choking fogs, thick walls, or seething bodyguards try to bar the way? Will we open cardboard boxes, enter looming castles, or peer into dark caves? Will we face fire-breathing dragons, sinister demons, or crying little boys and girls? It will all depend on what parts formed inside that person in reaction to their life experiences and on what their inner wisdom deems is ready to be seen and healed, once and for all.</p><p>Join Emily for a fascinating new mystery every week, a new search-and-rescue mission, a new adventure into the heart of humanity\u2019s darkness to reveal its truths and to witness inner darkness quickly and miraculously transform back to inner light.</p><p><strong>Who knows?

Not Perfect from Hot Mess to Life Success.</em> Born in a Brooklyn, NY Housing project she came of age during the dawn of the hip hop era and the emergence of the crack epidemic. Pregnant at 13, baby at 14, a college student at 16, dismissed from college at 18, and college graduate at 23, Dr. Shai knows the ups and downs of life from her formative young adult experiences. Now, this seasoned executive with a doctorate in law and policy, who is a successful author, speaker, entrepreneur, career/life strategist, non-profit board member, wife, and mom of three is here to share with women how to fail without being a failure. By telling her bold, transformative story, including her addiction to alcohol and hydrocodone at the height of her career she provides a roadmap for women on how to get free of self-blame, trauma, and shame that led to her struggles with perfectionism and imposter syndrome. Dr. Shai was on the killer quest for perfection until she learned that getting \u201cbetter\u201d was the true end game to abundant living. In her inaugural memoir, Better. Not Perfect: From Hot Mess to Life Success, she focuses her attention on women who are willing to find the courage to ultimately learn themselves, love themselves to be themselves, unapologetically.

Think of it like a game where both sides want to win, but they also want to avoid losing. It's like a dance where each person takes a step forward and a step back, until they find the right rhythm. Negotiation is about finding a way to get what you want while still being fair to others. So, whether you're haggling over the price of a used car or trying to resolve a disagreement with a friend, negotiation is all about finding a win-win solution.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Hi, I\u2019m Andrea Medina. Though I\u2019m in my early 20s, the history of relational trauma in my family lineage coupled with my own father\u2019s abuse and abandonment, has instilled in me a self-awareness and sensitivity to emotions from a young age. I was born in M<em>\u00e9</em>xico and raised in Compton, a community where I didn\u2019t have many mentors or influences that pointed me in the direction of emotional healing work. Still, I went on to publish <em>The Energized Self: A Journey to Interconnected Healing</em>, a book that is half memoir and half conversations with trauma survivors at the age of 22. This same year I began my public speaking journey and my master\u2019s program to become a Marriage and Family Therapist.</p><p>As I find myself rising to fulfill my soul\u2019s calling today, I am still in the same location where conversations like the ones had in this podcast aren\u2019t common. I\u2019m also faced with a myriad of economic and social challenges that I know listeners will relate to. My goal is that you\u2019ll see how it doesn\u2019t matter where you are, anyone can rise to achieve self-realization by integrating their perceived darkness. With unbound compassion, we will explore topics like self-hatred, resentment toward family members, need for validation, fear of being loved, rising out of trauma through achievement, the illusion of power in giving away your body, and many more. When we are brave enough to face these emotionally charged parts, we commit to meeting our full selves. We descend in order to create a lasting ascension in our embodiment.</p><p>Listening to the Empowered by Darkness Podcast is like entering a room where the atmosphere feels just right to let down your guard and allow your hidden pain to be seen, validated, and reframed to bring you closer to inner peace and power.</p><p><strong>New Episodes Every Monday, Uploaded Biweekly</strong></p><p>Connect with me on Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/itsdreamedina/\">https://www.instagram.com/itsdreamedina/</a></p><p>Find my book here: <a href=\"https://a.co/d/eD3009m\">https://a.co/d/eD3009m</a></p><p>Request a podcast episode: <a href=\"mailto:itsandreamedinag@gmail.com\">itsandreamedinag@gmail.com</a></p>",

So, we will start there with reflection and introducing you to yourself. This concept of self-awareness is truly the most amazing. Are you aware most people really don\u2019t even know themselves? The most rewarding part of this process for us is introducing you to yourself and watching you start to nurture and value yourself. For instance, we are going to show some how to lose the victim mentality and watch you all evolve into victors.</p><p>We are so blessed to be on this journey with you as this, my friend, will be the most important work you will ever do. Once your mental operating system is functioning at a higher capacity, everything else follows suit. Please trust me, the work is tough but so rewarding. Personally, I have been doing this work for over 20 years and I didn't have access to a coach. Rather, it happened very organically in my life. The work began with a will to just survive circumstances. Now, moving forward it is my life's purpose to coach, teach &amp; help others adapt to these principles so they can reach their fullest potential and lead an extraordinary life. Let's connect!</p>",

In this episode, I lay bare the raw truth about my personal experiences with fatphobia, the impact it had on my interactions with medical professionals, and the backlash of being a visibly happy and fat person. Listen in, as we navigate through the pain, the misconceptions, and ultimately, the triumph to self-love and acceptance. Discover how these experiences have shaped my identity and fueled my mission to help others struggling with body image and self-acceptance. This conversation might be raw, but it's real and resonates with a reality many shy away from. Let's delve into the heart of self-acceptance and body image together.</p><p><strong>Follow me on Instagram: </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chayla.photographer/\">https://www.instagram.com/chayla.photographer/</a></p><p><strong>Join the VIP Facebook Group: </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/908154196476775?_rdc=2&amp;_rdr\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/908154196476775?_rdc=2&amp;_rdr</a></p><p><strong>Book a free call or join my mailing list</strong>: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/chaylataylor\">https://linktr.ee/chaylataylor</a></p>",

I also did lots of good things and gathered lots of experience.</p><p>That's why I created this podcast to guide women in their 30s about how to relax, enjoy the ride, and make investments for their future health, wealth, and well-being, and give them tips on everything that life brings on, from parenting and relationships to career and financial stability. </p><p>I will not do this guidance alone; I will have guests from all backgrounds and lifestyles tell us what they had done right, what they wish they had known in their 30s, and what message they would have for their 30-year-old self.  </p><p>This podcast will guide you to discover your strengths and weaknesses, keep you accountable for the change you want, and leave you with the tools to adapt to future changes.</p>",

We have some traits which seem like habits, but in reality these are those traits which are directly controlled by the sub-conscious mind, vis-\u00e0-vis your habits or your routine can be changed if you can control and direct your sub-conscious mind positively. To be able to control this 'mind power' and use it to improve the quality of your life is no walk in the park. This is where this book acts as a guide and allows you to decipher the depths of the sub-conscious. In this book, 'The power of your subconscious mind', the author fuses his spiritual wisdom and scientific research to bring to light how the sub-conscious mind can be a major influence on our daily lives. Once you understand your subconscious mind, you can also control or get rid of the various phobias that you may have in turn opening a brand new world of positive energy.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This book was recommended by Robert T. Kiyosaki in <em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>. After reading both books, I understand that Kiyosaki has taken lots of insights from Clason. And I understand why, because this book is filled with wisdom!</p><p>At whatever stage you\u2019re at in your life right now, this is a must read, because one way or the other, it\u2019s going to help you improve the way you are living your life. We all have ambitions in life and desires we want to see realized. To be able to fulfill those ambitions and desires, we need to be successful with money. And this book brings the exact wisdom on how to do so. The first step is to always set aside a part of your earnings. However big or small it is, before paying anyone else, take at least 10% and keep it for yourself. When you have accumulated your savings, make sure what you have saved starts to earn. When taking advice on what to invest in, only take counsel from experienced people. And while doing so, don\u2019t forget to enjoy life while you\u2019re here. Live according to your income and don\u2019t be afraid to spend your money. Life is rich with things worthwhile and enjoyable. But don\u2019t confuse the necessary expenses with your desires. Budget for those necessary expenses and keep working within your budget, adjusting it when required.</p><p>Look for opportunities so your savings can be multiplied. Consult with professionals to guarantee safe investments. Be prepared to protect your family and be prepared for your retirement.</p><p>Respect yourself by cultivating your own powers, to study, to become wiser, and to become more skillful. As Clason puts it, \u201cWhere the determination is, the way can be found.\u201d</p>",
