Utilize the web and APIs to get the data that you need. Wrangle the data like a pro into a format suitable for analysis. Then calculate statistics to your heart's galore. Furthermore, learn how to build forecasting and prediction models to get an upper-hand on your competition.\n\nAt the Cannabis Data Science meetup, you can join like-minded individuals, learn modern data science techniques, and go through hands-on exercises with real cannabis data. This is a great opportunity for anyone in a cannabis-testing lab, anyone working at a cannabis cultivation or processing plant, any cannabis retailer, and even any cannabis researcher or consumer seeking knowledge. Please join us for a coffee, I like tea, for a fun time crunching cannabis numbers.
