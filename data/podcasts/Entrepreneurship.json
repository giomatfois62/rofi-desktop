Many times, I hear things people say and I usually need them to re-call what they actually said, but not this.  Her question to the audience was, \u201cDo you remember the moment when you no longer remembered who you were before?\u201d.  Immediately tears pooled in my eyes because I had been in that spot many times.  I looked at my sister next to me and no words needed to be spoken because we were thinking of the exact same thing.  As those next few notes rang out over the crowd from the grand piano, I had no clue what a wild ride this question would take me on, and the journey of self-discovery that should have happened years ago, but better late than never.  So here I am, freezing moments in time between friends!",

        "description": "This is a podcast + blog series born out of conversations about how literally every single one of us who enjoy craft beer, hard seltzer, cider, wine spritzers, canned cocktails, hard teas, hard kombuchas--you name it--is operating at a different level of knowledge. Some of us are connoisseurs, some of us are newbies. Some of us want to reach expert status, some of us really don\u2019t care how the sausage, or seltzer, is made as long as it tastes good--but so we do want to know how and why a particular seltzer does indeed taste good.\n\nWTF Am I Drinking? is an explainer series that will dive into different topics like what a certain beer or wine style is, how a hard kombucha gets made, what the difference is between a stout and a porter--things like that. It\u2019s educational and informational but in the most fun way possible--consider it the perfect thing to do while you sip your favorite beverage. You\u2019ll learn a thing or two, and no doubt develop a deeper appreciation for drink X, Y, or Z. Basically, we all get to geek out a little, and dish on the beverages we love.",

On this show, I talk to entrepreneurs about their own stories of survival and success. We discuss the players involved, the lessons learned, the strategy that helped them out of their death spirals and dive deeply into how these experiences changed the way they build and run businesses. \n\nI also urge my guests to talk more openly about how business catastrophe impacted their personal lives and mental health.\n\nEach episode will change how you see your own obstacles both personal and professional. \n\nEvery guest will teach you lessons to apply in your own life and business.

I was studying music business at the time and wanted to work in the industry after graduating, but wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do. So, this podcast became a resource for me that morphed into a passion project. You might be wondering why I named the podcast Sweaty Palms. Well, it's because when I get nervous, my hands sweat, and I tend to get nervous in social settings, like talking to people. Sometimes it's endearing, or at least that's what I tell myself. Through this process, I\u2019ve fallen in love with interviewing people, which I guess was a happy accident. If you're interested in listening each week, you'll hear from people who work in this industry, whether it\u2019s musicians, tour managers, talent buyers, venue owners, songwriters, and more. I'm happy to have you here, and thanks for listening. If you want to keep up with me and hear more updates follow me on Instagram @sweatypalmspodcast.</p>",

Growing up as a member of the Croatian diaspora in Los Angeles, I was always involved in the community but wanted to do more. One year ago I made the choice to quit my job and move to Zagreb where I'm studying the Croatian language and now focusing my efforts on this podcast. With this weekly series, I want to connect the global Croatian community and allow people to share stories, learn about new ventures, and discover \"All Things Croatia\" as I talk (in English) with people both in the Homeland and around the globe who have connections to Croatia. You'll hear from the latest startups, returning diaspora, influencers, Olympians (believe it!), musicians, app developers, tour guides, artists, athletes, and the biggest Croatian celebrities that will return my calls! I hope you enjoy these weekly episodes as much as I do while recording them, and thanks so much for your support! Follow on Instagram at @allthingscroatiapodcast for more content and videos!</p>",

We often only see the online successes but we don\u2019t see the offline journey\u2019s on how they got there. \n\n\nSo if you love all things business, personal development, spirituality & manifestation then this is the podcast for you!\n",

If you want to build a better place, start with listening. That is not all! Because if you listen well and try to understand all sides, you will find that you have so much more than your own story. Because in this world of ours that is so small and so fragile, we are bound together by stories. In such a world, curiosity, patience, open-mindedness, and empathy would be highly valued qualities. People would recognize the power of understanding and would actively strive to cultivate these qualities within themselves and their communities.

I invite practitioners, makers, healers, artists, musicians, & scientists on the show to share with you their wisdom and medicine.

        "description": "A lone wolf is defined as being a very independent and solitary person but what happens when these types of people get together, enjoy suffering, and have a singular objective they all have to work towards? This is the Wolfpack experience and comradery I have encountered on all my outdoor adventures. I have seen people change who they are on the inside as well as the outside during adventures that we have shared. From half day trips with cliff jumping into the river to backpacking trips up mountains that can have you questioning who you are and what is your purpose in just a 12-hour period. I am no expert in all things outdoors but will always be open to learning more, so I live for these experiences, these adventures, and can share them with you. I will provide the behind-the-scenes information about the videos posted to YouTube Channel and share insight about my recent adventures with guest appearances to add their point of view. As a professional guide, Certified Wilderness First Responder, and a small business owner in the outdoor services industry based in Las Vegas, NV, join me on conversations on what it is like to really experience the outdoors.",

My first non-academic job was at a biotech startup turning psilocybin into a medicine for depression. Things moved different: closer to my pace. I also saw areas where tech could make things much faster and more efficient. I was inspired and built a company to improve how we develop medicines today: Neuroute. In growing this company (government-backed, VC-backed) over the last 3 years, I've met thousands of people with different backgrounds and inspiring visions of the future.

        "description": "<p>Hello and welcome to my B2B Growth podcast. I am your host, Troy Hooper. A little about me...I own and operate a Farmers Insurance Agency in Caldwell, Idaho. I've been running my own agency for the past five years, but I have been in the industry for over 10 years now. Helping people is my passion and I am grateful I get to do that every day I go into work. Growing my agency is one of the most important things I can do for my business and my legacy. Being an entrepreneur has been an amazing feat in my life's journey but not every day has been easy. Without the help of other business owners, their trials and insight on how they overcame them have played a big role in some of my victories as a business owner. In my opinion, Business-to- business trading\u2019s is a master key to ones success. This is one of the many reasons why I decided to do this podcast. In this podcast you will hear from owners and operators of local businesses, telling their story and giving the community a sense of who is behind the scenes. Every week I will bring on a guest who I believe has something to teach us about owning and or operating a successful business. These guests are industry experts, leaders, entrepreneurs, authors, and creators. No matter what industry, there is always something that can be learned by listening to other entrepreneurs and business operators. There\u2019s a chance a big nugget of knowledge another professional might share that could help launch you to the next level of where you want YOUR business to be. I dig into how they got to where they are today, what they have learned from their experiences and research what we can learn from them. I\u2019m really excited to share this with you and my hope is that you will be able to use their knowledge and experiences to improve something about YOUR business, here on the B2B Growth podcast. And what a great way to promote these businesses on this platform and inform the community about what\u2019s going on in their industry. Please be sure to follow us, like us, subscribe to us, all that social media jargon so you will be up to date on upcoming episodes.</p><p>For more information on me and my insurance business, check out the links below.</p><p><a href=\"https://agents.farmers.com/thooper\">https://agents.farmers.com/thooper</a></p><p><a href=\"http://YouTube.com/@HooperInsurance\">YouTube.com/@HooperInsurance</a></p><p><a href=\"http://facebook.com/Hooperinsuranceagency\">facebook.com/Hooperinsuranceagency</a></p><p><a href=\"http://instagram.com/hoopinsagency/\">instagram.com/hoopinsagency/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/troyhooper/\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/troyhooper/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/troylhooper\">https://twitter.com/troylhooper</a></p><p><a href=\"https://business.caldwellchamber.org/list/member/farmers-insurance-troy-hooper-agency-3054\">https://business.caldwellchamber.org/list/member/farmers-insurance-troy-hooper-agency-3054</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cascadechamber.com/business-directory/8717/farmers-insurance-troy-hooper-agency/\">https://www.cascadechamber.com/business-directory/8717/farmers-insurance-troy-hooper-agency/</a></p>",

        "description": "<p>Welcome to Cambio de Ritmo's podcast.</p><p>Cambio de Ritmo directly translates to \u201cchange of rhythm\u201d but in sports, soccer especially, the same phrase would be \u201cchange of pace\u201d.</p><p>Cambio de ritmo is a phrase I heard a lot growing up, whether it was being advised to me by a coach to include more cambios de ritmo, changes of pace, into my game, or listening to commentators talk about how players like Riquelme, Messi, and Iniesta were masters at doing so.</p><p>In my own way of understanding it, a cambio de ritmo is a change of pace and/or direction in one\u2019s movement in order to disrupt and impede the speed and direction the opposing player and team are moving at in order to create distance from one or more of them, to create separation in order to receive a pass from a teammate, or open up space so one can make a pass or take a shot themselves. Along with other things you can imagine.</p><p>Changing your pace in the game, whether you have the ball or not, is crucial if you want to simply make any play happen</p><p>I\u2019ve experienced lots of \u201ccambios de ritmo\u201d, more-so looking at the translation as \u201cchange of rhythm\u201d. My playing career and life as a whole up to this point have gone through many changes of rhythm, sometimes willingly and sometimes not, as I\u2019m sure is true with those of my guests\u2019.</p><p>At Cambio de Ritmo, it is believed that these changes are essential in the improvement and sustainability of every athlete both in their sport and life. From having away-from-sport interests and goals to overcoming obstacles in sport, cambios de ritmo are what makes every person who they are.</p><p>One thing we know about cambios de ritmo is that they make it very hard for the opposing team to read one's movements and plays. However, this podcast aims to follow our guests' pathway very closely.</p>",

Many think they provide adequate retirement income advice for clients nearing and living in retirement. Many think they are building relationships with women. Most will find out too late they are not.</p><p>-         We want the listeners to get new, different, and interesting information from the show that they can use to understand the reality out there. They\u2019ll build from:</p><p>o   <strong>Real women. Real stories.</strong> Each woman\u2019s journey is fascinating and filled with unique steps and stumbles and successes. As a society, we don\u2019t celebrate her journey. They are looking for much more than a spreadsheet, a quarterly report on earnings, and a pie chart. But most advisors are not delivering.</p><p>o   <strong>And income.</strong> Dave and Marcia are veterans of the retirement savings and retirement income industry. They know women have been left out of the conversation. They know financial advisors are struggling to understand women clients and win their assets for the long-term. And, they know how women get left out of the money decisions, due to a combination of laws that put her in the backseat and financial advisors who don\u2019t include her in the process or conversation.</p><p>-        In this podcast, we\u2019ll help advisors change course before it\u2019s too late. To help women successfully manage through retirement and have the income they need and want, changes are necessary. Advisors will hear from:</p><p>o   Boomer women about their life\u2019s journey and where they are going next.</p><p>o   From Gen X women who feel left out of the conversations despite their success.</p><p>o   And, from Millennial women who are completely reinventing life as we know it.</p><p> </p><p>It\u2019s no secret women will control the majority of wealth in the next 10 years. It\u2019s estimated that more than two-thirds of wealth will be held by women in the US by 2030. That\u2019s some $30 Trillion that will change hands over the next several years.</p><p>Our mission is to educate financial advisors, wealth managers, and insurance advisors in every channel on how to best serve this powerful market. First from a boomer women\u2019s perspective. Then how to further adapt to handle new challenges and a different definition of \u201cretirement\u201d for younger women.</p>",

On this program, We\u2019ll discuss the challenges that face rural America and the anti-animal agriculture agenda that seeks to eliminate our way of life. But in the face of these ongoing battles, we\u2019ll explore impactful solutions and meaningful pathways to profitability in order to keep producers on the land, to safeguard our private property rights, and to keep meat, dairy, and eggs on the dinner table.</p><p>And in stark contrast to the ugly, divisive headlines in today\u2019s mainstream media, \"The Heart of Rural America\" will celebrate the faith, family values, patriotism, and work ethic of the incredible people I meet in my travels as an agricultural speaker. I hope you\u2019ll be inspired by these agricultural entrepreneurs and rural families, just as I am.</p><p>Now let\u2019s hit the dusty trail together as we uncover The Heart of Rural America. - Amanda</p>",

        "description": "<p>The inspiration for this podcast came from Raghavendra, a friend I met in India in 2012 through couchsurfing. Our bond grew over the years, and during a trip to India in 2023, he suggested I start a podcast. Despite being jetlagged and high, I embraced the idea. My wife was initially hesitant due to concerns about quality, but I decided to dive in and improve as I go.</p><p>A bit about me: I was born in Sverdlovsk, now Ekaterinburg, known for its historical significance and as a cultural crossroad between Europe and Asia. My upbringing was challenging. After the 1998 economic crisis, my father turned to alcohol, leading to his separation from our family when I was 13. My mother worked multiple jobs to support us. I wasn't academically inclined, but my mother's guidance led me to study project management at Ural State Technical University. During my studies, my sister introduced me to the Work&amp;Travel program in the USA. My trip to Maine in 2006 was transformative, exposing me to a new culture and broadening my horizons. After university, I also earned a military degree, ironically in bridge-building, given my humanities background.</p><p>This is just the beginning of my story, and I have much more to share.</p><p>The topics that I plan to cover in this podcast: politics, psychedelics, feminism, marketing, business, sex, drugs, music, philosophy, change, humans, etc.</p>",
