This podcast is designed to be a deep dive critical film analysis on children's media as well as entertaining every time. I designed this podcast for fans of the shows, new parents who are raising their children with intention, people who are so busy they can't keep up with watching everything but want to be able to talk about it, and for the people in my life to have a place to talk about our favorite films. What makes me qualified to talk about this? Well for starters, I grew up as a traumatized kid, so I know what not to do as a parent. Also since I was healing from my neglectful childhood, I learned a lot about trauma and life along the way. I am also a SAG-AFTRA actress with her own production company living in Los Angeles so I know what makes a good film and what it takes to make it.  You might have also noticed that unlike other podcasts, my episode art changes. I have a lot of pictures from my creative work, so I make the episode art an actual art piece inspired by the film.

        "description": "Many of you may know me as an actress in Michael Crichton\u2019s Premier film \u201cWestworld\u201d in which I played Arlette, robot prostitute who seduced & gave favors to Richard Benjamin. Now Richard was a fantastic actor to work with especially because he knew I was uncomfortable having to disrobe and undress. \n\nRichard might have been uncomfortable during that scene but I never noticed a hint of it. Off-screen he was a happily married man to a beautiful and highly talented actress Paula Prentiss, known for her comedy roles in many films. \n\nI\u2019d like to mention that when actors don't have any lines of dialogue, it\u2019s not as easy as you would think. Without words, the character has little to work with. As an audience, think about it and imagine what or how You would convey your thoughts to another person if you were unable to speak. Well, if you don\u2019t agree, try it sometime. It isn\u2019t easy my friends. \n\nAlso, it was inferred that handsome James Brolin was having his way with another saloon gal. FYI - As an aside, James Brolin is married to the iconic \u201cOut of this World\u201d Singer, Actress, Award-Winning Barbra Streisand. \n\nMeanwhile, Brolin's character was being pursued by the Man in Black, Gunslinger Yul Brynner who was brilliant, outstanding, and very scary. Mr. Brynner was best known for being the staunch King in the legendary film \"The King and I\" with Award-Winning actress Deborah Kerr.  \n\nNow regarding television, there was a well-known series called The Green Hornet (Green Hornet Music.. )in which you may know me as VAMA, the One and Only woman in history to \"ZAP\" the Great, Incomparable Bruce Lee as CATO.  During and between \"takes\" Bruce and I would talk at length about so many things but honestly He did most of the talking. He said he didn't easily open up to others but felt like he'd known me for a long time. That he felt safe & very comfortable. \n\nIn The Batman 66 series (Batman Music)  I was The Riddler's female villain \"MOTH\". I will be giving fans much to chew on when talking about the show's Hero Adam West, his sidekick Burt Ward and the forever Memorable Frank Gorshin. Certainly More to share at another time. \n\nThere are a slew of many other series such as Bewitched with Elizabeth Mongomery and Dick York, Lost in Space, Bonanza, and my Introductory and very first role in Ben Casey as well as many other roles in which I guest-starred.\n",

Finally we decided to get off our lazy Asses and start recording our nightly rants, reviews and conversations on all things entertainment (but mainly horror movies). We hope to turn this into a safe haven for all the things we love and love to hate, with the desire to create a space to meet and talk with like minded individuals like us. So join us on this trek. And maybe we can answer that age old question \"what really is the worst movie ever made\".",

Join us every week to see what is worth watching or watch along with us! Our podcast will cover topics that differ based on the movies we watch and we will try to keep our commentary at the same level, so Rated R movies will be have an explicit warning. We will also separate the art from the artist so we will not be talking in full about anyone involved with these movies that have done horrible things. We give movie a rating on a 0 to 100% scale and this is strictly our personal biased based on how the movies were to us.

        "description": "<p>After having sought the truth his whole life, Vatman (Winston) fell for the many lies of the world falling into atheism and a life of sin. While having many scary experiences with the occult and demonic attacks, he finally realized that God was true, but his question was what religion's God was true? Having been baptized in the Catholic Church, but experiencing a traumatizing uncatholic childhood, he was left feeling like in no way was the Catholic Church the real Church of God. Having avoided the True Church and trying out many spiritual practices, God finally revealed His power and truth to Vatman (Winston). With the experience and research he could no longer doubt the Catholic Church.</p><p>After having been in love with the fantasy stories that came off the comic book pages and superhero movies, Cardinal (Sebastian) always wished that these stories were true or that superpowers were real. Funny enough he found out that they were true. After being caught by God in a time when he was finally willing to submit to him and attempt to give up sin, it was revealed to him how truly marvelous God is and how much He is a superhero and one that is real. After coming back to the Catholic church he met even more superheroes with the Saints. It was clear how much God's Saints are almost like sidekicks with real life superpowers being given from the real superhero himself Jesus.</p><p>Together The Catholic Dynamic Duo Podcast hope to provide a fun open space for all believers and non-believers hoping to be a great representation of Christ and not coming off as people trying to brainwash. Hopefully as a believer or not you can find enjoyment in our conversations of how much the true story of the Catholic faith influences fan favorite fictional storytelling, showing how marvelous and super heroic the Catholic faith truly is. Being the greatest Catholic detective duo, thanks to the Holy Spirit, we're able to see God's creativity in every nerdy work of fiction.</p><p>Holy Catholic Church Vatman !</p>",

Discussions are glued together with fond memories, private jokes and aimless banter.</p><p>From Ian's shoutouts to classic film characters such as 'Sausage Charlie' to his shrewd observation of supermarket trolly quantum mechanics, to Anthon's nigh eidetic attention to detail and Ben's nihilistic approach to filmic discourse, this podcast is a shout-out to the <em>duped</em> <em>generation</em> - Viva La Higher Education Act 2004! </p>",

The New International Version translates the passage as: \"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Read Bible when you don't feel to reading Worship when you don't feel to worshipping 2. Guard Your Heart to Sins ( 1 Peter 5:7) (Proverbs 4:23) Only Jesus can provide the rest that you're looking for Have a good relationships to Jesus Christians, dili biyaan ang Ginoo, ayaw talikdi ang Ginoo. Dili magpakasala kay mao ni hinungdan. Christians, do not leave the Lord, do not turn away from the Lord. Don't sin because that's the reason. We christians are not for this world. Sin lead to stress, and we got nothing of tender joy of it. If the christian continues to sin, our spiritual life and relationships to Jesus will slowly die \"Sin leads to wickedness\" \"The single most important thing in your life is the condition of your heart\". Proverbs 28:14 - Blessed is the Man who always fears, but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble If we sin, repent immediately and Choose to trust God. 3. CHOOSE TO TRUST GOD Isaiah 30:15- For thus said the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel: In returning and rest you shall be saved; in quietness and in trust shall be your strength. Why we should trust God? 1. God gave his life for you 2. God Loves You so much (Jeremiah 31:3 ) 3. God has always provided for You 4. God knows better than you (Luke 12:7) \u201cAnd the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows.\u201d Lamentations 3:22-23 ( Do read in the Bible) Let's Hold on the Promise of the Lord! Importante ta sa Ginoo! If we don't apply the word of God, we will not be healed. Even we have many memory verse. If we don't apply the word of God, we will not be change, and this some reason christians will back into the past and slowly weakens in serving God.</p>",
