Chemistry, physics, and biology are the standard go-to science subjects taught extensively in schools, yet delving into astronomy is uncommon and restrained. But in an age dominated by space science, it is imperative that people have an understanding of it, and why not start this experience with some conversation? This podcast hopes to inspire everyone to never stop thinking about what lies there when you look up! We'll be delving into astronomy research, internship opportunities, interviews with professionals, and more! Stay tuned for more!</p>",
