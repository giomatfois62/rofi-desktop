Sin embargo, pueden haber muchas opciones y poco tiempo para poder analizar sus funcionalidades y potenciales ventajas con calma. Digital Gastronomy Talks, es un espacio para dar visibilidad a los proveedores de nuevas soluciones tecnol\u00f3gicas y al mismo tiempo, conectar con una audiencia interesada que pueda generar un debate en torno a las mismas. \n\nPara ello en cada sesi\u00f3n se busca invitar a uno o m\u00e1s expertos en diferentes materias para contar sus experiencias bajo una tem\u00e1tica en concreto. Se trata de webinars de una duraci\u00f3n promedio de una hora, en la cual se alternan ponentes, se realizan preguntas a los invitados, as\u00ed como las que pueda tener la audiencia a trav\u00e9s del chat. \n",
