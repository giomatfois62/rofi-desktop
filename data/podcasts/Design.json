        "description": "Design is Not Neutral is a podcast built from a thesis project. As a present design master's student at the University of Notre Dame, I began a broader inquiry into the way design as a field was built and the way we now teach design. After doing more research, it became clear - that design in the United States has a diversity problem. The roots of our diversity issue are squarely in how we define and teach Graphic Design. Graphic Design was made for white, cis-gendered, able-bodied men in consumer-driven societies. With this foundation, how we determine what is \u2018good design\u2019 has become extremely exclusionary. Yet, despite increased conversation around equity, design education has yet to dramatically change. The designers and design educators interviewed on Design is Not Neutral have all deeply researched the field of design education in order to improve our field. This podcast will not only provide listeners with resources on how to challenge their own perceptions of what design has been defined by, it will also provide concrete examples of how this work is being done in classrooms. I hope you enjoy each conversation as much as I did and if you liked Design is Not Neutral please check us out on Instagram.",

        "description": "29% Equal is a podcast celebrating significant women who have shaped how we practice architecture today, produced by Sarah Ackland. \n-\nWhy 29% Equal? The last formal survey undertaken by the ARB (or the Architects Registration Board) was in 2019, this revealed that only 29% of qualified architects are female-identifying, women are routinely excluded from the architecture profession, from the books we read and even the references and precedents we study at university. \n-\nIn an effort to eliminate this continual erasure of women I have invited a young architect, designer, artist or activist from Part W (and friends) to have a discussion with a woman they feel deserves recognition, or perhaps more recognition. We ask these amazing women about their defining moments, their activism, who inspires them, the advice they would give to their younger selves and finally what a more equitable city might look like. \n-\nThis series is in conversation with Part W.\nPart W is an action group of women working across architecture and design, infrastructure and construction campaigning for gender parity founded by Zo\u00eb Berman. Part W is an independent campaign group that has no formal funding. If you would like to support their valuable and ongoing work, please donate here or on their website.\n-\nTo give you a hint of what\u2019s to come in this six-part series, we talk to an acclaimed social housing architect, a powerful campaign group, a member of Matrix the feminist design collective, and more. \n\nThis podcast has been created with thanks to the RIBA Research Fund and supported by my research supervisor Katie Lloyd Thomas of Newcastle University. \nAll graphics are by the amazing Linda and Ella of Mackinnon Byrne. \nPlease subscribe to stay updated.\n",

Con un approccio critico, il podcast si pone come uno strumento contemporaneo che mira ad aprire un dialogo sui limiti e le potenzialit\u00e0 del design, attraverso la contaminazione tra diversi ambiti di ricerca, come l\u2019antropologia, la filosofia e la botanica. Tramite questo processo di apertura, riflessione e contaminazione reciproca, e grazie alla partecipazione di diversi ospiti, esploreremo come il design pu\u00f2 comunicare con le altre discipline e verso quali frontiere ridirezionare un design riparatore, in vista di un mondo post-antropocentrico interconnesso.</p>",

Chris and Wythe take a sensitive, curious, ecumenical approach to game design, and their perspectives are informed by years of work on their own games. Between conversations, Chris and Wythe work through specific problems in the course of playing new games, often with one of the games\u2019 designers.</strong></p><p><strong>On the show, Chris and Wythe speak to a roster of different TTRPG designers, with a focus on professional and professionalizing indie designers who share a broadly Leftist ideological bent. (\u201cDesigners\u201d includes writers, artists, graphic and layout artists, voice talent, and many others, but most guests have a strong hand in mechanical game-design per se.)</strong></p><p><strong>Through the show, Chris and Wythe hope to amplify new creative voices, connect with leading indie designers, and work through a range of mechanical and narrative questions that are pertinent to many designers, players, and GMs.</strong></p><p><strong><em>Why We Roll</em> is both entertainment and resource, part of a longstanding tradition of \u201cshowing our homework\u201d in the indie TTRPG community as well as a showcase of fresh, new, and even challenging ideas about what makes imagination-based games so powerful.</strong></p>",
