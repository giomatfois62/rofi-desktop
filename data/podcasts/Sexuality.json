Each episode will dive headfirst into not only the dynamic of their relationship but various topics that are... a little all over the place - just like them. From their history together to past experiences and even people that came after their relationship, they will comically and openly give their insight. While this may be full of laughs and innuendos, it will also explore some deep and personal topics and touch on all the ways relationships can develop, grow and change over time and everything in between. Ex BestFriends will either leave you in deep thought or trying to make sure nobody can tell you're listening to two people talk about their sex lives - just depends on the episode!

This podcast was birthed from a really special place, in a moment of complete surrender and transformation. It comes from a place of pure love for all that is in this wild world we live in. \n\nThe title for me represents a change in thinking, a change in being. Until not long ago I spent my life carrying around this feeling of never fitting in, self isolating, keeping my vulnerable side silent and afraid of completely owning who I am, rejecting myself before someone else could reject me. Mind you I didn't realise I was doing any of this in the moment. Self reflection and awareness what a beautiful thing! \n\nFor so long I craved that feeling of being accepted, of fitting in but what I didn't realise was that it was me who needed to accept myself all along. My intention for this podcast is to help people find their sense of peace, love, sexuality, pleasure and purpose as well as wholeness and appreciation for all that is.\n\nEveryone is welcome here. You are welcomed, love and accepted here. \n\nThis podcast is going to be fun, random, chaotic and full of #livelaughlove energy because thats who I am. \n\nConnect with me on my instagram @whowantstofitinanyway\n\nCant wait to connect.\n\nLater lovers,\nBec x\n\n",

It asks, Can love be examined like an object? What on earth is love? Where in the world is love? Are we born to love, born with a natural sense of certain things like goodness, and beauty? Is love, like Rumi said, perfect thirst? But most importantly it will follow the question: can there be love without love stories?\n\nThe host, Adnan Mahmutovi\u0107 is a Bosnian-Swedish writer and lecturer in English literature and creative writing at Stockholm University.\n\nIf you have a particular story you want to talk about send us your pitch to: lovediscontents@gmail.com.",

        "description": "<p>I'm a <strong>Former Police Officer &amp; now a Sex Coach &amp; Educator,</strong> not new to controversy; I shatter taboos &amp; coach businesswomen to live freely &amp; authentically.</p><p>I left the Police Force after feeling the heaviness of having to hide my sexual side or have it used as a target - my femininity was often perceived as a weakness however now I Coach Women to use it to their business advantage.</p><p>There's nothing saucier or more controversial than the topic of Sex, i joined this industry after leaving the Police Force and I am loving bring a whole new wave of sexual liberation and conversations to Business Women across the Nation.</p><p>I joined the Police Force with the intention to help people, I actually wanted to help people in the way more people cannot, hence why I decided a career in Policing was for me. After having kids and realising there was actually more politics involved that conflicted with my values I decided to make the change to become a Coach.</p><p>I studied NLP &amp; started Mindset Coaching for Women, butttt I kept feeling a pull back to sex, relationships, intimacy and feminine power. Everything about sexuality &amp; sensual living appealed to me, i'd always been interested in tantra and the taboo topics so it felt completely natural for me to seek out a way i could incorporate this into my Coaching.</p><p>Becoming an Entrepreneur couldn't be further from a career as a Police Officer where all the rules and regulations were set out for you, regardless of whether or not you agreed with them - you had to follow them and enforce them. Working for myself and growing a business required the complete opposite of this, I taught myself to push back against \"norms\" that didn't suit me and found a new way to do business - a feminine way.</p><p>I have structures in place to support how I like to flow in my business, this lets me be more creative and intuitive where it suits me. As a Mum I also need flexibility in my work and want to live a life i'm proud of, which as a parent seems to be my most honourable role yet.</p><p>I swear, I talk about sex like it's the most casual thing in the world because to me it is. I want everyone to feel into the power of their sexuality which really encompasses all things, it's NOT just what happens in the bedroom but also in your daily life. It's where you find pleasure, how you convey your opinions in conversations and how you hold space for others to show up as their unique selves as well.</p><p>The topic of Sex within the Police Force really does bring some heat, as the industry is male dominated I felt i had to suppress this sexual side of. myself otherwise it would be misinterpreted as an invitation i wanted to sleep with whoever was around.. Not the case. Suppressing this side of me was not something I every thought i'd have to do.</p><p>I love my sexual side and find it POWERS my business to the heights it's growing, I want listeners to hear my story and feel enlightened, empowered and excited to use their sexual energy to unlock new levels of business success. I want listeners to hear how magnetic you become when you honour your sexual energy and how you deepen all your relationship when you do, it's an energy you cannot replicate any other way.</p><p>I'm fiercely passionate about breaking free some societal norms that are outdated and do not support an honest version of who a person wants to be.</p><p>I liberate Women to feel confident in their bodies, sensuality &amp; desire for more out of life which when fully accepted we become a truely formidable force in both a personal capacity &amp; a professional one.</p><p>I am open to all the conversations about sex, empowerment, and success, encouraging Women to make their own rules and choose a path that suits them - inspiring them to embark on a truly extraordinary journey of self-discovery.</p>",

In this short series, I speak with folks from all walks of life, including those who have researched sex education, taught sex education, criticized sex education, praised it, and those who did not have it at all. In order to destigmatize this topic, we need to talk about it. And if that's too scary, we can at least listen to others talk about it, because I learned more than I ever thought I would by doing just that. Sit down, relax, and take a listen.

        "description": "<p>Growing up in a home riddled with domestic abuse and a mother fighting her own body image demons, I learned to see myself through a distorted lens. From being put on a diet at the tender age of nine, to a lifetime of navigating the constant reminders of my size, will you believe it took me twelve grueling years to get a much-needed medical diagnosis?</p><p>Join me on this journey as I recount a path marked by societal norms, self-doubt, and a hard-fought battle with self-acceptance. In this episode, I lay bare the raw truth about my personal experiences with fatphobia, the impact it had on my interactions with medical professionals, and the backlash of being a visibly happy and fat person. Listen in, as we navigate through the pain, the misconceptions, and ultimately, the triumph to self-love and acceptance. Discover how these experiences have shaped my identity and fueled my mission to help others struggling with body image and self-acceptance. This conversation might be raw, but it's real and resonates with a reality many shy away from. Let's delve into the heart of self-acceptance and body image together.</p><p><strong>Follow me on Instagram: </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chayla.photographer/\">https://www.instagram.com/chayla.photographer/</a></p><p><strong>Join the VIP Facebook Group: </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/908154196476775?_rdc=2&amp;_rdr\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/908154196476775?_rdc=2&amp;_rdr</a></p><p><strong>Book a free call or join my mailing list</strong>: <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/chaylataylor\">https://linktr.ee/chaylataylor</a></p>",
