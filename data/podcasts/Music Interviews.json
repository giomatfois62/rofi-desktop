Russell will share information on chart placing and overall success of the singer/band.\nWe will find out if Rebekah thinks the music has stood the test of time as she gives her verdict as to whether it's a hit or a miss!",

Going beyond the Flyover New Music Series, in Chatting With Creators, I connect with various creatives from the music industry to talk to them about how they\u2019re dealing with the pandemic, their advice for students, and most importantly, how we all stay connected even when we\u2019re apart. \n\nI thought this would be a one-and-done series, but I've had so many requests to continue!

        "description": "\"I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon, one of the best underground music scenes in the world. I got into the underground metal scene in the early eighties and found punk a few years later. Sometimes for better, sometimes for worse, punk has been one of the biggest influences of my life ever since. I've been in a few bands and toured every chance I got. I've been a booker at a few clubs and even owned a couple. With my background, I was excited to see my niece and nephew get into punk. I was also a little worried, but they are smarter than me so have avoided making the same mistakes. It made me wonder what, after almost 50 years, still attracts people to the subculture. Also, what keeps people involved into their 30\u2019s, 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s and beyond. Charlie Harper is in his 70\u2019s and has been touring since 1976. I\u2019ll be talking to bands from around the world, and also people who keep punk alive behind the scenes. I\u2019ll be asking them what attracted them to punk in the first place and what keeps them around for decades. I\u2019m looking forward to the conversations, because sometimes I can't even answer it for myself. Beware, there will be a lot of talk about Portland. I moved to Amsterdam a few years ago and miss Portland every day, so I love to hear stories about it. Also, as much as I hate some things about it, it is one of the best cities on earth. Also beware, these are real stories- well, most of them are. They will contain tales of alcohol, drugs, sex and extreme violence and language that Mary Whitehouse would not approve of. Take caution and thank you listening, I appreciate each and every one of you.\"\nWritten and Hosted by Tony Mengis Produced & Edited by Chelsea Clyde Mixed and Mastered by Joe Mengis",

We hope you enjoy this podcast and it brings you just a small bit closer to the comfort Cobblestone through the medium of conversation.\n\nWith thanks to Tom Mulligan for giving us this opportunity and Neillidh Mulligan for allowing us the use of his tune, Barr Na Cuille, as our theme. Thanks To Stephen McCann For his tireless work on sound.\n\nfind us @ http://cobblestonepub.ie/\n                 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ispini_na_heireann/\nget in touch @ sausagesofireland@gmail.com\n\nHosts: Adam Holohan & Tomas Mulligan (Ispini Na hErieann)\nSound: Stephen McCann\n",

So far listened to interviews with @Teenbeat463 , Sarah Records, @GlennDonaldson (sadly no Der TPK mention) and Rocketship (some great nuts and bolts info on the recording process). Thoroughly enjoyable!\u201d - Auxiliary Out Blog\n\n\n\u201cI just listened through when I was out walking in the Glasgow rain - this is such a fantastic episode. Claire was very open and engaging and your questions were balanced and the ones I would have probably asked too.\u201d - profcolinclark\n\n\nThe Vinyl Detroit Podcast features dad and vinyl enthusiast Brian as he takes listeners through some of his favorite records. With many being somewhat obscure and others not so much, Brian digs into the origins of the artist, recording and art direction and design of the record.\n\nThe podcast will also feature long form interviews with some of the artists and labels digging deeper into their creative process, inspirations and influences and more. Brian, who is an interviewer in his professional life and a recovering musician, has the ability to connect with the artist on their level.\n\nSo sit back, relax and let's give it a spin.",

        "description": "<p>Hi everyone, I'm Zo\u00eb, and welcome to the Sweaty Palms Podcast. Sweaty Palms is a music industry podcast I started in my final semester of college. I was studying music business at the time and wanted to work in the industry after graduating, but wasn't exactly sure what I wanted to do. So, this podcast became a resource for me that morphed into a passion project. You might be wondering why I named the podcast Sweaty Palms. Well, it's because when I get nervous, my hands sweat, and I tend to get nervous in social settings, like talking to people. Sometimes it's endearing, or at least that's what I tell myself. Through this process, I\u2019ve fallen in love with interviewing people, which I guess was a happy accident. If you're interested in listening each week, you'll hear from people who work in this industry, whether it\u2019s musicians, tour managers, talent buyers, venue owners, songwriters, and more. I'm happy to have you here, and thanks for listening. If you want to keep up with me and hear more updates follow me on Instagram @sweatypalmspodcast.</p>",

        "description": "Hi everyone! I\u2019m Yael and welcome to The Brass Ceiling.\n\nI am a trumpet player, but also a musician, and most importantly, a storyteller. I also happen to be a girl, and despite it being 2022, only 3% of trumpet players are female. Consequently, I have always had to navigate a male-dominated environment riddled with gender, age, and power dynamics\u2026 in other words I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of crap and I\u2019m sick of it!\n\nThe title of this podcast, The Brass Ceiling, is really just a play on the phrase \"the glass ceiling\"; this pun on the famous saying feels relevant as I want to bring to light the gendered struggle that female brass players experience which is preventing them from thriving in this niche, just as on a more macro level, women and most non-straight-cis-white-men have to navigate countless systems that were not built with them in mind.\n\nI want to use this space to talk about our stories and our musical journeys, but I also want to use this platform to crowdsource and workshop ideas to make the arts more equitable. The goal is to find that sweet spot that is fun and nostalgic, but also rigorous and forward-facing. I\u2019m hoping that by sharing our experiences, by engaging in dialogue about the systems that need changing, and by delving into music in a way that is accessible as well as palatable,  that we will in fact be shattering the Brass Ceiling, together.",

Artists, both famous and unsung, relate these tales in their own jazz inflected vocabulary. Original music and commentary from the host help set the tone, both educational and swinging.\n\nMonk Rowe (https://www.monkrowe.com/), creator of the podcast series, Jazz Backstory, and the Joe Williams Director of the Fillius Jazz Archive, conducted the majority of  the interviews and has presented programs about the resource at conferences for the Jazz Education Network, the Music Library Association, and the International Society of Music Educators.

Magnetic Meaning unpacks this notion and dissects the words and ideas that connect the music and resonate with those who work with it. \nEach episode will feature different guests from across the music industry, each doing amazing things in their own right. These guests will each bring a word to the table that has impacted their life or career in one way or another. From there, we will tackle that word from every conceivable angle in hopes to add a bit more context to what the music industry actually is. \n\nEpisodes are published on a bi-weekly basis, first thing every other Thursday.",

Most of their friendship has been long distance and paired with their busy lives, it seemed to be a recipe for disaster. But, over the years, they have shared music as a way to reach out, keep in touch, and keep tabs on each other. Whether it was through collaborative playlists, seasonal playlists, or even a quick song here and there; Two Weeks From Tuesday is unique in its approach, serving as a podcast as well as a platform for new artists. And when they can\u2019t be live and talking to you, they\u2019re still with you through corresponding playlists made for their listeners for every episode. \n\nThis podcast truly wraps music and life into one entity and demonstrates how essential music is to the human experience. Most of all, Two Weeks From Tuesday aims to be honest. Co-creators, Aliya Bloom and Erynn Wakefield, truly want to reach out to their listeners with a helping hand and say, \u201cwe understand.\u201d \n",

        "description": "<p><em>...where tradition meets innovation, and together, we bring PIANO into the 21st Century.</em></p><p>Hey, \ud83c\udfb9 enthusiasts out there! My name is Yukimi, a classical pianist and educator from NYC and executive producer of The Piano Pod. The Piano Pod\ud83c\udf99 is a one-of-a-kind podcast that delves deep into the fascinating world of classical music, with a specific focus on the \ud83c\udfb9 piano. In a biweekly format, the show explores intriguing discussions with guests breaking exciting new ground in the classical music industry.<a href=\"https://thepianopod.com\"> The Piano Pod</a> aims to nurture a thriving community that embraces innovative approaches to ensure classical music's relevance and vitality in today's dynamic landscape.</p><p><strong><em>\"How can I present the beautiful tradition of classical music to the 21st-century audience in a fun, contemporary, and engaging way?\"</em></strong></p><p>When I started building<a href=\"https://yukimisongstudio.com\"> a piano studio</a> in the trendy neighborhood of Downtown Manhattan in 2007 while in the NYU graduate program in piano studies, I began to ponder this question. I realized the stark difference in expectations toward classical music and music education between music professionals and the general public. Then, one of the NYU music department's professors suggested I start a podcast: the platform would allow classical musicians to address this disparity and spark conversations about audience engagement.</p><p>Finally, fast forward to 10+ years later, The Piano Pod was born in the summer of 2020. Since then, I have had the privilege of interviewing A-listers in the classical music industry: international concert pianists, composers, arrangers, digital streamers/influencers, music educators, entrepreneurs, neurodiverse specialists, and performance psychologists.</p><p>Through fascinating conversations, we have explored how classical music should continue to evolve to remain relevant to our lifestyle, society, and culture. Over the past three seasons, The Piano Pod has achieved remarkable success by reaching faithful listeners on <a href=\"https://rss.com/podcasts/the-piano-pod/\">audio platforms</a> and viewers via <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ThePianoPod\">YouTube</a>.</p><p>As the show is celebrating the past season's achievements and gearing toward the new season in the fall, my mission as the Executive Producer is crystal clear:<strong> to provide a platform for classical musicians and educators to reflect and discuss ways to keep our industry robust and meaningful in this ever-changing world and move it forward in the post-pandemic era. </strong></p><p>\ud83d\udd17Follow TPP on <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/thepianopodnyc\">social media accounts</a> to get the latest news about \ud83c\udfb9. </p><p>Thanks for listening\u2665\ufe0f\ud83c\udfb9</p>",
