I tended bar for seventeen years everywhere from hot spots to dive bars and I thought I had seen it all.\n\nIn my life behind bars I witnessed everything from first dates and marriage proposals to knife fights and a woman who brought a pet monkey in for a drink.\n\nNothing could surprise me.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThen I heard about how a lion who visited Harry\u2019s New York Bar in Paris inspired Ernest Hemingway to write one of his greatest novels. And why there are century old chicken bones hanging above the beer-stained bar at McSorleys in New York City. And how Vincent Sardi refused to do business with the mob during Prohibition, so his famous Broadway Restaurant didn\u2019t serve alcohol until the 21st amendment passed, six year after they first opened.\n\nWith the help of the Last Call radio players, music and interviews with cocktail detectives Jared Brown and Anistatia Miller, The Indiana Jones of Tiki, Jeff \u201cBeachbum\u201d Berry and Two and Two: McSorley's, My Dad, and Me author Rafe Bartholomew, I bring these stories, and many more, to life in my podcast Last Call. It\u2019s fact folded in with a sprinkling of fiction, because, well, who doesn\u2019t exaggerate after a few drinks?\n\nSo, open that bottle of wine or crack that beer and join me for an intoxicating guided tour of some of the strange stories from some of the world\u2019s best boozers.",

If you're searching for a pristine, flawless, skyrocket to raw perfection, keep searching. This is not it. My raw journey resembles a big pile of knotted zoodles. I bought my first raw book, Juliano's RAW in 2000. In 2006, I finally realized that raw a was an actual lifestyle, not just a handful of freakishly disciplined people, and I started 'going raw.' I've gone raw and fallen down literally hundreds of times. But I'm always learning and honing my skills. I will not stop. I can't. There's nothing like raw. I believe it's the absolute best version of myself, hands down, the person I was meant to be. How can you discover your full potential, if you're not using the best fuel and becoming your best self? Raw veganism is an incredibly healing path. It's also the way I choose to manage my ADHD and the most effective way I've discovered since being diagnosed at age 6. In 2005 at hypnotherapy school, I experienced a powerful dream, did dream a therapy session on myself and developed an obsession with self healing. Off the top of my head, I've healed uterine fibroids, squamous skin cancers, UTIs, sinus infections, plantar fasciitis, bronchitis and most recently an undetermined autoimmune illness. Join me for an honest look at a raw path and growth.</p>",

So we became Soul Sister in our own twisted way.  First meet Allie who is a fiery blonde with freckles, a successful real estate powerhouse and mother of 2. She started as a teen Mom who attended beauty school as a start her intro into adulthood. Which is where she met a fellow teen Mom Samantha who is now a dark haired gypsy, thriving blogger, emotional support coach and single mother of 2.  Little did we know we would meet each other during a time of growth, hardships and misfortune. Over 15 years later these Twisted Sisters have overcame failed relationships, solo parenting, poverty, starting businesses from scratch, marriage and overcoming debt. To defying near death illness, navigating the business world at a young age, becoming a widow to suicide and learning how to follow our passions/dreams despite certain challenges.  In our battle through life we have made some wonderful connections and relationships with some very prominent people. We are thrilled that we get to share these beautiful souls with all of you and discuss the various impacts in their lives which in turn helped lead them into success and happiness. Follow these Twisted sisters as they believe despite certain hardships, you can't take life too seriously, imperfection is beauty and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. </p>",

        "description": "<p>Hey everyone! I'm Stanko Zovak and your host of the All Things Croatia podcast. Growing up as a member of the Croatian diaspora in Los Angeles, I was always involved in the community but wanted to do more. One year ago I made the choice to quit my job and move to Zagreb where I'm studying the Croatian language and now focusing my efforts on this podcast. With this weekly series, I want to connect the global Croatian community and allow people to share stories, learn about new ventures, and discover \"All Things Croatia\" as I talk (in English) with people both in the Homeland and around the globe who have connections to Croatia. You'll hear from the latest startups, returning diaspora, influencers, Olympians (believe it!), musicians, app developers, tour guides, artists, athletes, and the biggest Croatian celebrities that will return my calls! I hope you enjoy these weekly episodes as much as I do while recording them, and thanks so much for your support! Follow on Instagram at @allthingscroatiapodcast for more content and videos!</p>",

Follow me as I venture through this land that has, for so long, been mostly hidden from the rest of the world. This is my love letter to a region that has stolen my heart, a document of its people and their passions, their pride in the community, and their hopes for the future. But more than that, it is also a journey of self-discovery, as I get to know a place, I hope to one day call home. This is Epirus Falls.</p>",

        "description": "Venice Talks is a podcast series about Venice in Italy, hosted by Monica Cesarato, who is putting her insider experience at your disposal to help you experience the city at 360 !\n\nThere is a reason why Venice is one of the most visited cities in the world: is it perhaps because its attractions are something absolutely unique? Absolutely so. Nowhere else will you find a city built entirely on water with a glorious history spanning centuries.\n\nBu there are two ways to visit Venice: following the rush of tourists who in a few hours drag themselves along a predetermined route chosen by about 20 million people every year, or leaving this path trying to discover a less postcard-worthy Venice.\n\nI think you can do both: you can go and enjoy Saint Marks\u2019 Square and its monument or the Rialto Bridge admiring the Grand Canal, fighting though with the crowds to be able to take a souvenir photo.\n\nBut you can also get out of the clich\u00e9 about Venice and discover that there are extraordinary places even in a city that in itself is out of any ordinary. Venice is not just about its monuments and its history: it\u2019s about its people, the Venetians.\n\nSo,if you are planning your vacation, or it is already organized but you are looking for more useful tips for visiting Venice, you are on the right place.\n\nThis is a weekly podcast on the Venetian people, their lives and struggles in the city of Venice.\n\nEvery week, Venice Talks aims to find what\u2019s going on among the canals and small alleyways, uncovering the stories and speaking to the people that matter. These conversations aim to animate, educate and create discussions about how to visit Venice the right and sustainable way. We do this through sharing fascinating stories about the past, present and future of Venice. This podcast is a cultural platform to discuss the most salient issues facing our city today and celebrate the people, organisations and stories behind The Serenissima.\n",
