His first game was Wembley in 1999 for the Division 2 playoff final and he and his Dad have had a season ticket since for Manchester City. \n\nListen to our podcast here and we don't want to talk too much about expectations of the game and about stats and facts just pure memories and stories of our time watching Manchester City as Lad and Dad. \n\nWe know many of our football friends go to football with their Dad and this is to remind us of those times we all have. \n\nFor now it will be about our time watching Manchester City Football Club only because that is who we support but who knows where we could get too in the long run as we would love to hear other Lad and Dad stories from other teams too. Just not Man United, Tottenham or Everton haha. \n\nEnjoy. Up Tha Blues! ",

We'll explore what it takes to stand out on the field and the strategies young players can employ to attract the attention of scouts.</p><p>In our second episode, we'll put ourselves in the shoes of a scout to understand the qualities they hunt for when they're in the stands, watching the magic unfold on the pitch.</p><p>In the third episode, we delve into the intricate process of getting scouted, helping to demystify this crucial, yet often misunderstood, path to a professional football career.</p><p>Next, we'll shift our focus to what exactly a player should be working on to pique the interest of scouts. It's not all about scoring goals, you know!</p><p>After a successful trial, life can change drastically. We'll give you an insider's view of what happens next in episode five.</p><p>Our sixth and seventh episodes are all about the numbers, the stats, the data.
